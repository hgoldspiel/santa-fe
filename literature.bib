abstract = {Wildland fires are expected to become more frequent and severe in many ecosystems, potentially posing a threat to many sensitive species. We evaluated the effects of a large, stand-replacement wildfire on three species of pond-breeding amphibians by estimating changes in occupancy of breeding sites during the three years before and after the fire burned 42 of 83 previously surveyed wetlands. Annual occupancy and colonization for each species was estimated using recently developed models that incorporate detection probabilities to provide unbiased parameter estimates. We did not find negative effects of the fire on the occupancy or colonization rates of the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum). Instead, its occupancy was higher across the study area after the fire, possibly in response to a large snowpack that may have facilitated colonization of unoccupied wetlands. Naive data (uncorrected for detection probability) for the Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris) initially led to the conclusion of increased occupancy and colonization in wetlands that burned. After accounting for temporal and spatial variation in detection probabilities, however, it was evident that these parameters were relatively stable in both areas before and after the fire. We found a similar discrepancy between naive and estimated occupancy of A. macrodactylum that resulted from different detection probabilities in burned and control wetlands. The boreal toad (Bufo boreas) was not found breeding in the area prior to the fire but colonized several wetlands the year after they burned. Occupancy by B. boreas then declined during years 2 and 3 following the fire. Our study suggests that the amphibian populations we studied are resistant to wildfire and that B. boreas may experience short-term benefits from wildfire. Our data also illustrate how naive presence-non-detection data can provide misleading results.},

abstract = {Habitat restoration is typically focused on reestablishing suitable conditions at a local scale, but landscape constraints may be important for keystone species with limited dispersal. We tested for time lags and examined the relative importance of local and landscape constraints on the response of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) to restoration of Chihuahuan Desert grasslands in New Mexico, USA. Dipodomys spectabilis is a keystone species that creates habitat heterogeneity and modifies the structure of plant and animal communities. We selected 21 sites and compared density of D. spectabilis between areas treated with herbicide to control shrubs (treated areas) and paired untreated areas. We evaluated whether density of D. spectabilis depended on treatment age, local habitat quality (vegetation and soil structure), and landscape factors (treatment area and spatial connectivity). Density was greater at treated areas than at untreated areas due to a direct effect of reduced shrub cover. However, the response of D. spectabilis to restoration was lagged by a decade or more. Structural equation modeling indicated the time lag reflected a dispersal constraint as opposed to a temporal change in habitat quality. This inference was corroborated by a positive relationship between density at treated areas and connectivity to source populations. Our results indicate that density of D. spectabilis depended strongly on the spatial configuration of treated areas, which supports a landscape mosaic approach to restoration. If keystone species commonly exhibit limited dispersal ability, landscape constraints may be broadly important for shaping ecosystem structure and function after habitat restoration.},

abstract = {Since the late 1980s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has helped restore hundreds of wetlands in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, in an effort to enhance the production of waterfowl and other wetland associated species. During summer 2004, we re-examined I I restorations to determine how their plant communities had changed since 1992. In addition, we re-evaluated waterfowl and anuran communities at eight restorations. Because 1992 data were compiled from separate studies, all three groups of organisms were simultaneously examined at only two wetlands. Significant decreases in plant diversity and plant species richness were detected between 1992 and 2004, while significant increases were detected for species classified as obligate or facultative wet. These changes suggest that the plant communities at the restorations have matured since 1992. Use of the wetlands by waterfowl and anurans, on the other hand, did not exhibit significant change over this period. Regular monitoring of restorations over even longer periods will provide new insights into the way in which restored communities develop and whether current restoration methods have succeeded in establishing stable, species-rich wetland communities.},

abstract = {One challenge an analyst often encounters when dealing with complex mark–recapture models is how to limit the number of a priori models. While all possible combinations of model structures on the different parameters (e.g., phi, p) can be considered, such a strategy often results in a burdensome number of models, leading to the use of ad hoc strategies to reduce the number of models constructed. For the Cormack–Jolly–Seber data type, one example of an ad hoc strategy is to hold a general phi model structure constant while investigating model structures on p, and then to hold the resulting best structure on p constant and investigate structures on phi. Many comparable strategies exist. The effect of following ad hoc strategies on parameter estimates as well as for variable selection and whether model averaging can ameliorate any problems are unknown. By means of a simulation study, we have investigated this informational gap by comparing the all-combinations model building strategy with two ad hoc strategies and with truth, as well as considering the results of model averaging. We found that model selection strategy had little effect on parameter estimator bias and precision and that model averaging did improve bias and precision slightly. In terms of variable selection (i.e., cumulative Akaike's information criterion weights), model sets based on ad hoc strategies did not perform as well as those based on all combinations, as less important variables often had higher weights with the former than with the all possible combinations strategy. Increased sample size resulted in increased variable weights, with an infinite sample size resulting in all variable weights equaling 1 for variables with any predictive influence. Thus, the distinction between statistical importance (dependent on sample size) and biological importance must be recognized when utilizing cumulative weights. We recommend that all-combinations model strategy and model averaging be used. However, if an ad hoc strategy is relied upon to reduce the computational demand, parameter estimates will generally be comparable to the all-combinations strategy, but variable weights will not correspond to the all-combinations strategy.},

Yet, stable isotope analysis indicated that suburbanization altered nitrogen dynamics and resource use in the food web. We observed increases in 15N in algae, biofilm, and frog larvae across the suburban gradient, indicative of wastewater intrusion.

abstract = {Age estimation is important for management of turtle populations, but techniques such as growth ring counts or skeletochronology may be unreliable or impossible to perform. An alternative is to estimate age from growth models using Bayesian inference. However, individual variation in growth parameters needs to be incorporated into these models for them to generate realistic prediction intervals. For long-lived ectotherms such as chelonians, it is also important that models allow for changes in growth at sexual maturity, and that the growth models are combined with prior distributions reflecting realistic age structures. We describe how a hierarchical biphasic growth model fitted to a long-term data set of carapace length measurements for North American snapping turtles was combined with prior age distributions generated from survival estimates for the same population. The model was used to generate individual posterior age distributions for turtles captured on 2 or more occasions, and also for hypothetical turtles of any length that were measured only once. Posterior age distributions for hypothetical turtles were uncertain at any size due to individual variation in growth parameters, supporting the belief of many herpetologists that size is weakly related to age. Age estimates for adult turtles were also sensitive to the prior used. Using the most realistic prior, the 95{\%} prediction intervals for large hypothetical turtles (38-cm male or 31-cm female) ranged from about 25 to 170 yrs with a median of about 70 yrs. Posterior age distributions for turtles first measured as juveniles ({\textless} 24 cm) were insensitive to the prior, and estimation precision was improved by individual growth information obtained from recaptures. For example, the 95{\%} prediction interval for a hypothetical 10-cm turtle ranged from 2 to 14 yrs using the most realistic prior, whereas the ages of small ({\textless} 24 cm) turtles that were recaptured at least once could usually be estimated to within 1-3 yrs. Similar models could be applied to any data set where measurements and survival data are collected from a large sample of marked individuals, and could potentially be extended to incorporate data on other age indicators. This methodology allows us to produce age estimates that can be applied to management and advocacy of turtle populations while accounting for the inherent uncertainty involved.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. The lack of consistent differences between the traits of native and non-native plant species makes it difficult to make general predictions about the ecological impact of invasive plants; however, the increasing number of non-native plants in many habitats makes the assessment of the impact of each individual species impracticable. General knowledge about how specific plant traits are linked to their effects on communities or ecosystems may be more useful for predicting the effect of plant invasions. Specifically, we hypothesised that higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) and percent lignin in plant detritus would reduce the rate of development and total mass at metamorphosis of tadpoles, resulting in lower metamorph production (total fresh biomass) and amphibian species richness. 2. To test these hypotheses, we raised five species of tadpoles in mesocosms containing senescent leaves of three common native and three common non-native wetland plants that varied in C:N ratio and {\%} lignin. 3. Leaf mass loss, total metamorph production and the number of species that metamorphosed declined as a function of increasing C:N ratio of plant leaves. Plant lignin content was not related to the production of metamorphs or the number of species that metamorphosed. The percentage of wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) and American toad (Anaxyrus americanus) tadpoles reaching metamorphosis declined as a function of increasing plant C:N ratio. Mean time to metamorphosis increased and mean mass at metamorphosis declined as a function of increasing plant C:N ratio. Tadpole performance and metamorph diversity and production (biomass) were similar between native and non-native plant species with similar C:N ratio in leaves. Percent lignin was not a significant predictor of tadpole performance. 4. Our results show that the impact of a plant invasion on tadpole performance could depend on differences between the quality of the detritus produced by the invading species and that of the native species it replaces. We suggest that plant community changes that lead to dominance by more recalcitrant plant species (those with higher leaf C:N ratio) may negatively affect amphibian populations.},

abstract = {Vernal pools provide critical breeding habitat for amphibians adapted to temporary waters, but they seldom receive the same level of protection as permanent wetlands. In response to continued degradation and loss of pools, managers often attempt to mitigate losses through pool creation or restoration. However, mitigation efforts often fail to provide suitable aquatic habitat for vernal pool amphibians. We review the literature on pool creation in northeastern and central North America, highlighting how and why constructed pools often fail to support amphibian-related objectives. We recommend that practitioners consider the complex ecology of pool ecosystems and the historical and current distribution of pools and other wetlands in their local context before designing pool mitigation projects. Using vernal pool creation as a mitigation option should be a last resort (i.e., when elimination of natural pools is unavoidable). Monitoring should be target-specific and conducted for at least 5 years. Topographic, geologic, and other local factors affecting pool hydrology and ecology vary regionally; pool creation remains an imperfect science that will only advance by documenting failures and successes. We recommend an adaptive management approach to vernal pool creation in which the effectiveness of techniques is evaluated and refined based on research.},
annote = {Recommendation: incorporate complex ecology of pool ecosystems and historical/current distributions in the local context into pool mitigation projects
- there is a strong need for studies to assess post-breeding habitat requirements of vernal pool species


Petranka {\&} Holbrook (2006) - the only journal article that has studied spatial configuration of pools at landscape scale
- design criteria should mimic natural configurations (if patchy, created pools should be clustered with different hydroperiods)

Different species have different post-breeding habitat needs, but overall species need:
- at least 50{\%} canopy cover (Gibbs 1998, Patrick et al. 2006, deMaynadier and Houlahan 2008)
- 30m is critical habitat for newly emerged juveniles, 300m is core foraging and migration habitat (Rittenhouse and Semlitsch 2007)

Creation = compensatory mitigation requirement accompanying loss of a natural pool or as part of a program to augment or diversity habitat
Restoration = returning a pool from altered or degraded conditions to preexisting conditions

Vernal pools not normally included under federal and state wetland regulations due to their "hydrologically isolated" nature (Mahaney {\&} Klemens, 2008)

Diseases less likely in wetlands that dry

Created pools tend to have longer hydroperiods and different water chemistry conditions than natural pools

Created pools tend to have steeper slopes than natural pools 

Canopy cover affects conditions in pools via moderation of temperature (shade) and detrital food webs (leaf litter)},

abstract = {In predator-prey metapopulations, persistence of prey in patches with predators may depend on the rescue effect in which immigration from nearby sources prevents local extinction. Thus, constraints on spatial connectivity may have important implications for predator-prey coexistence. We tested the hypothesis that metapopulation dynamics of Ambystoma tigrinum (tiger salamander) depend on combined effects of predatory fish and spatial connectivity. Because matrix heterogeneity can influence dispersal, we also considered how a proximate constraint on amphibian dispersal—desiccation risk—scales up to influence metapopulation dynamics for A. tigrinum. Occupancy and subsequent turnover patterns were quantified in a network of 90 wetlands for three years in an agricultural landscape in Illinois. Our previous field experiments demonstrated that desiccation risk varies among matrix habitats, and that individuals orient movements towards habitat with low desiccation risk.We used cost-distance modeling to generate a connectivity metric that accounted for desiccation risk. Occupancy and colonization probabilities were related negatively to fish occupancy and positively to connectivity. Matrix structure had a strong influence on colonization, and the connectivity metric based on desiccation riskwas a better predictor of colonization than alternative metrics. The positive effect of desiccation-informed connectivity on colonization was strongest in wetlands with fish, indicating matrix composition can moderate the effects of predation on amphibians. We detected a rescue effect in which extinction probability was related negatively to connectivity, and this effect was strongest in sites with fish. The matrix did not have a strong effect on occupancy or extinction probabilities, and we discuss why matrix effects may vary for different aspects of population turnover. Our results suggest effects of fish predators on metapopulation dynamics of amphibians depend on spatial connectivity, and that immigration may be essential for maintaining persistence of amphibians in systems with fish. This study also demonstrates that the mechanisms underlying dispersal limitation for A. tigrinum may include desiccation risk},

Yet, our understanding of contributions from the world{\^{a}}€™s second largest peatland, the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada, to peat-climate-C-dynamics is constrained by the paucity of dated peat records and regional C-data. Here we examine HBL peatland development in relation to Holocene C-dynamics. We show that peat initiation in the HBL is tightly coupled with glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) through most of the record, and occurred within suitable climatic conditions for peatland development. HBL peatlands initiated most intensively in the mid-Holocene, when GIA was most rapid and climate was cooler and drier. As the peat mass developed, we estimate that the HBL potentially released 1{\^{a}}€“7{\^{a}}€‰Tg CH4 per year during the late Holocene.

abstract = {Species distributions are influenced by many processes operating over varying spatial scales. The development of species distribution models (SDMs), also known as ecological niche models, has afforded the opportunity to predict the distributions of diverse taxa across broad geographic areas and identify variables that are potentially important in regulating these distributions. However, the integration of site-specific habitat data with broad scale climate and landcover data has received limited attention in an SDM framework. We investigate whether SDMs developed with breeding pond, landcover, and climate variables can accurately predict the distributions of nine pond-breeding amphibians in eastern Missouri, USA. Additionally we investigate the relative influences of each environmental variable on the distribution predictions for each study species, and whether the most influential variables are shared among multiple taxa. Boosted regression tree (BRT) SDMs were developed for each species with 38 abiotic and biotic environmental variables, including data from the breeding ponds, surrounding landcover, and climate. To test the models, field surveys were performed in 2007 and 2008 at 103 ponds for nine amphibian species. BRT models developed with breeding pond, landcover, and climate data accurately predicted the occurrences of six of nine species across the study area. Furthermore, the presence of each species was best predicted by a unique combination of environmental variables. Results also suggest that landcover and climate factors may be more influential for species near the edge of their geographic ranges, while local breeding pond factors may be more important for species nearer to the center of their ranges.},

abstract = {Recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models represent a major advance over traditional capture-recapture (CR) models because they yield explicit estimates of animal density instead of population size within an unknown area. Furthermore, unlike nonspatial CR methods, SCR models account for heterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of animal activity centers and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is gaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely identified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop models for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby allowing SCR concepts to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially marked populations. The data required for our model are spatially referenced counts made on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely spaced sample units such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our approach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and uses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and location of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates, sound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count data, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated that while the posterior mean exhibits frequentist bias on the order of 5-10{\%} in small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as adequate spatial correlation is present. Marking a subset of the population substantially increases posterior precision and is recommended whenever possible. We applied our model to avian point count data collected on an unmarked population of the northern parula (Parula americana) and obtained a density estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95{\%} CI: 0.19-1.64) birds/ha. Our paper challenges sampling and analytical conventions in ecology by demonstrating that neither spatial independence nor individual recognition is needed to estimate population density - rather, spatial dependence can be informative about individual distribution and density.},

abstract = {We surveyed cove hardwood stands aged 15, 25, 50, and ≥85 years following clearcutting in the southern Appalachian Mountains of northern Georgia to assess the effects of stand age and stand habitat characteristics on salamander communities using drift-fence array and pitfall methodologies from May 1994 to April 1995. Over a 60,060 pitfall trapnight effort, we collected 3937 salamanders represented by Desmognathus aeneus, Desmognathus monticola, Desmognathus ocoee, Desmognathus quadramaculatus, Eurycea bislineata, Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, Pseudotriton ruber, Plethodon glutinosus, Plethodon serratus, and Notophthalmus viridescens. Analysis of covariance with pitfall array to stream distance as the covariate showed that salamander species richness and diversity measures and numbers of Desmognathus aeneus and Desmognathus ocoee were highest in stands ≥85 years. Eurycea bislineata and Plethodon glutinosus were more abundant in stands ≤50 years old than in stands ≥85 years. Within cove hardwood stands, species richness and diversity measures and relative abundances of Desmognathus spp. and Gyrinophilus porphyriticus were negatively correlated with distance to stream. Species richness and diversity were positively correlated to amounts of emergent rock. Species richness, diversity and relative abundances of Desmognathus spp. were correlated with basal area within stands and extent of connected mesic, cove hardwood habitat and amount of cove habitat within 1 km radius among stands. Eurycea bislineata was negatively correlated with landform index, a measure of surrounding landform sheltering, and Plethodon glutinosus was positively correlated with elevation in cove hardwood stands. Our research indicates stand age is an important factor in explaining the abundance and community composition of salamanders in southern Appalachian cove hardwood communities. Because southern Appalachian woodland salamander communities are slow to recover and are substantially changed following disturbances such as clearcutting, populations in small, isolated cove hardwood stands might be more vulnerable to extirpation or may require longer recovery times than those in larger coves. Managers may need to assess habitat features such as cove extent and habitat connectivity to minimize impacts on these taxa by forest management activities in southern Appalachian cove hardwood communities.},

Overall, species richness and diversity were highest in the oldest forests. Desmognathus spp. presented the strongest relationships with forest maturity, with greater diversity, richness, and relative abundances in older stands. Desmognathus spp. abundances were also correlated with basal area and the extent of mesic, cove hardwood habitat connnectivity. Other species displayed various responses to age and other habitat features. The researchers advocated for future management and research to focus on connectivity of mature forested ecosystems for salamander conservation. },

abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change presents challenges and opportunities to the growth, reproduction, and survival of individuals throughout their life cycles. Demographic compensation among life-history stages has the potential to buffer populations from decline, but alternatively, com- pounding negative effects can lead to accelerated population decline and extinction. In montane ecosystems of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, increasing temperatures are resulting in a transition from snow-dominated to rain-dominated precipitation events, reducing snowpack. For ectotherms such as amphibians, warmer winters can reduce the frequency of critical minimum temperatures and increase the length of summer growing seasons, benefiting post-metamorphic stages, but may also increase metabolic costs during winter months, which could decrease survival. Lower snowpack levels also result in wetlands that dry sooner or more frequently in the summer, increasing larval desiccation risk. To evaluate how these challenges and opportunities compound within a species' life history, we collected demographic data on Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) in Olympic National Park in Washing- ton state to parameterize stage-based stochastic matrix population models under current and future (A1B, 2040s, and 2080s) environmental conditions. We estimated the proportion of reproductive effort lost each year due to drying using watershed-specific hydrologic models, and coupled this with an analysis that relates 15 yr of R. cascadae abundance data with a suite of climate variables. We esti- mated the current population growth (ks) to be 0.97 (95{\%} CI 0.84–1.13), but predict that ks will decline under continued climate warming, resulting in a 62{\%} chance of extinction by the 2080s because of compounding negative effects on early and late life history stages. By the 2080s, our models predict that larval mortality will increase by 17{\%} as a result of increased pond drying, and adult survival will decrease by 7{\%} as winter length and summer precipitation continue to decrease. We find that reduced larval survival drives initial declines in the 2040s, but further declines in the 2080s are compounded by decreases in adult survival. Our results demonstrate the need to understand the potential for compounding or compensatory effects within different life history stages to exacerbate or buffer the effects of climate change on population growth rates through time.},

abstract = {Successful multi-use planning for forested landscapes requires an understanding of timber management effects on wildlife species. Lungless, woodland salamanders depend on forested habitats and are sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture associated with many forestry practices. Additionally, woodland salamanders are territorial and have relatively low vagility, making it unlikely that they can successfully migrate to more favorable habitat when the surrounding forest is harvested. Therefore, we examined the abundance of the Western Slimy Salamander, Plethodon albagula, in an experimentally manipulated forest in central Missouri. We used artificial cover object searches to compare salamander abundance in three replicate treatments that were clear-cut then burned to reduce maple regeneration, clear-cut and not burned, partially harvested, and un-manipulated control forest. We captured a total of 300 Western Slimy Salamanders between April 2007 and September 2011. We found significantly fewer salamanders in the burn and clear-cut treatments compared with the partial and control treatments. We also found a lower proportion of juveniles and had fewer recaptures in the burn and clear-cut than in the partial and control treatments. Consistent with other studies of woodland salamanders, our results suggest that for at least the first 7. years post-harvest, clear-cutting is detrimental to woodland salamander populations. This initial reduction in abundance combined with the further reduced proportion of juveniles may have longer lasting effects even as the forest regenerates. Finally, it appears that timber harvest resulting in limited canopy thinning may be compatible with maintaining populations of Western Slimy Salamanders in Missouri. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

All salamanders were marked via toe clips. They hoped to compare the different hypotheses of salamander declines following management (1. mortality, 2. retreat, 3. evacuation). They attempted to used the Dali-Madsen model (colext in unmarked), which is essentially an open population version of the N-mixture model, to look at dynamic changes in abundance over time. However, their model did not fit so they tried dynamic occupancy models, which also did not fit their data. They ended up using ANOVA to compare total captures among silvicultural treatments, assuming equal detection among forest types (they later set a precedence for this from a list of references). Abundances were lowest in the burn and clearcut treatments and highest in the control and partial cut treatments. There were no differences between the control and thinning treatment, which the authors took to conclude that canopy removal is more impactful than canopy thinning. Interesting, the researchers found no different in body condition, but they did a difference in age structure. Juveniles tended to avoid canopy removal treatments more than adults. Because of their poor model fitting, they were not able to make strong conclusions on the alternative hypotheses of salamander declines following harvest. They conclude by discussing ways to improve their investigation and future studies that would yield more fruitful statistical inferences.},

abstract = {Human activity commonly has negative impacts on wildlife. Often, however, only a single element of the life cycle is affected, and it is unclear whether such effects translate into effects on population growth. This is particularly true for research into the causes of global amphibian declines, where experimental research focuses primarily on the aquatic larval stages but theory suggests these stages have only minor importance for population growth.We used data from long-term mark-recapture studies of two natural populations of the salamander Salamandra salamandra to confirm the predictions of population models. One population remained stable (i.e., stationary) throughout the 20 years of the study whereas the other declined to local extinction. We used mark-recapture models to break down population growth rate into its two main components, recruitment and adult survival. Survival of postmetamorphic salamanderswas constant over time in the stable population, whereas the declining population was characterized by a decrease in survival and constant recruitment. Population growth was most sensitive to variation in adult survival. Current amphibian research focuses on preadult stages, and researchers assume recruitment is the most important determinant of population growth. This may not be the case. A better understanding of amphibian population dynamics is possible only through the integration of experiments, theory, and data from natural populations. Our results also suggest that amphibian conservation efforts should focus on all stages of the life cycle and their associated habitats},

abstract = {Previous research on habitat associations of pond-breeding amphibians has used community assemblages as response variables because the intensive labor required to quantify population size is usually prohibitive. However, wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) oviposit egg masses that can be surveyed rapidly; thus, we were able to quantify the influence of within-pond parameters on their annual breeding effort. During 2000-2001, we assessed the effects of hydroperiod, within-pond vegetation, canopy closure, hydrologic isolation, fish occurrence, and pond size on egg mass counts of wood frogs and spotted salamanders at 124 ponds in western Rhode Island. Study sites were stratified by road density, which served as an indirect measure of non-breeding habitat quality and quantity. Hydroperiod had a significant influence on annual breeding effort. Egg masses of both species were most abundant in seasonal ponds that dried between I August and 30 November. Breeding populations of spotted salamanders were smaller in ponds that dried before the end of July, whereas breeding populations of wood frogs were reduced in ponds that did not dry during our two-year study. Both species usually attached egg masses to shrubs or branches in shallow water near the water surface, which may explain why both species oviposited more egg masses in ponds with substantial vegetation complexity, including extensive coverage by shrubs and persistent non-woody vegetation. Although wood frogs were more likely than spotted salamanders to avoid ovipositing in ponds with fish, egg mass counts of both species were substantially reduced in ponds containing fish. Numbers of egg masses for spotted salamanders and wood frogs were similar between larger ponds and those as small as 0.05 ha and 0.15 ha, respectively. Previously, researchers proposed protecting isolated wetlands {\textgreater} 0.2 ha to sustain populations of pond-breeding amphibians, but our research suggests that wetlands as small as 0.05 ha may provide critical breeding habitat for some species in southern New England.},

abstract = {During the last decade, forest certification has gained momentum as a market-based conservation strategy in tropical forest countries. Certification has been promoted to enhance forest management in countries where governance capacities are insufficient to adequately manage natural resources and enforce pertinent regulations, given that certification relies largely on non-governmental organisations and private businesses. However, at present there are few tropical countries with large areas of certified forests. In this study, we conducted semi-structured stakeholder interviews in Ecuador and Bolivia to identify key framework conditions that influence the costs and benefits for companies to switch from conventional to certified forestry operations. Bolivia has a much greater relative area under certified forest management than Ecuador and also significantly more certified producers. The difference in the success of certification between both countries is particularly notable because Bolivia is a poorer country with more widespread corruption, and is landlocked with less access to export routes. Despite these factors, several characteristics of the Bolivian forest industry contribute to lower additional costs of certified forest management compared to Ecuador. Bolivia has stronger government enforcement of forestry regulations a fact that increases the cost of illegal logging, management units are larger, and vertical integration in the process chain from timber extraction to markets is higher. Moreover, forestry laws in Bolivia are highly compatible with certification requirements, and the government provides significant tax benefits to certified producers. Results from this study suggest that certification can be successful in countries where governments have limited governance capacity. However, the economic incentives for certification do not only arise from favourable market conditions. Certification is likely to be more successful where governments enforce forestry laws, provide financial incentives for certified forestry, and provide land tenure security, and where large-scale and vertically integrated forestry operations are commercially feasible. For this reason, at present, there are few developing countries where forest certification is likely to achieve widespread success.},

abstract = {Landscape-level variables operating at multiple spatial scales likely influence wetland amphibian assemblages but have not been investigated in detail. We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant being Rana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, and Bufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish and Ambystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.},

To investigate the impacts of past and present land uses on stream salamander communities across both ecoregions, we surveyed streams associated with different land uses at the riparian zone and watershed. Using the USGS land-cover data set (2006) and aerial photographs (1940), we assessed the current and historical percent land cover (urban, agriculture, and forests) at local and landscape scales for each sampling site. Using percent land cover as predictors and diversity indices (species richness, Simpson's index, and relative abundance) as response variables, we developed a stepwise multiple regression model and a redundancy analysis. Both analyses indicated the negative impacts of historical land uses, particularly row-crop agriculture, on stream salamander diversity and community structure ...},
annote = {Historical agriculture displays strong effects on the species richness and diversity of riparian salamanders (Desmognathus, Eurycea, Pseudotriton, and Gyrinophilus) in the Piedmont ecoregion of the southeastern United States. The researchers conducted stream surveys of salamanders for two years in 101 reaches across the Blue Ridge and Piedmont ecoregions. Sites were selected randomly in a stratified fashion that included locations historically disturbed by logging or agriculture and sites currently disturbed. The environmental history of the two ecoregions varied - disturbances in the Blue Ridge mountains were limited to logging and local patches of agriculture while those in the Piedmont region consisted largely of widespread agriculture. The majority of both regions has returned to forest, though they have undergone recent developments. Factor analyses and redundancy analyses were conducted to compare effects of land-use legacies across regions. Models containing historical land-use components ranked in the top model sets for both regions, though moreso for the Piedmont subset of sites. The authors conclude that "current and historical land uses are equally important predictors of species richness in the Blue Ridge, whereas only historical land-use variables were important at the Piedmont." This likely reflects the more intensive, long-term effects of agriculture relative to logging. The authors add that recent urbanization patterns, though spatially limited, displayed strong effects on species richness and diversity in the Blue Ridge region - highlighting the spatially dispropotionate impact of urbanization on amphibians and their habitats. There was no effort to measure the exact type of land-use legacies (e.g., habitat covariates) that may be driving these amphibian patterns in their study.


Piedmont and Blue Ridge have drastically different land-use histories. The Piedmont region was heavily converted to agricultural land - most is forest now. The Blue Ridge region was heavily logged and underwent local farming, and is now mostly forested.

Land-use history had a higher negative impact on species richness and SI in the Piedmont region (ag history) than the Blue Ridge region (logging).},

abstract = {This thesis is an attempt to constructively interpret and critically evaluate the liberal doctrine that we may not limit a person's liberty for her own good, and to discuss its implications and alternatives in some concrete areas of public health policy. The thesis starts theoretical and goes ever more practical. The first paper is devoted to positive interpretation of anti-paternalism with special focus on the reason component – personal good. A novel generic definition of paternalism is proposed, intended to capture, in a generous fashion, the object of traditional liberal resistance to paternalism – the invocation of personal good reasons for limiting of or interfering with a person's liberty. In the second paper, the normative aspect of this resistance is given a somewhat technical interpretation in terms of invalidation of reasons – the blocking of reasons from influencing the moral status of actions according to their strength. It is then argued that normative anti-paternalism so understood is unreasonable, on three grounds: 1) Since the doctrine only applies to sufficiently voluntary action, voluntariness determines validity of reasons, which is unwarranted and leads to wrong answers to moral questions. 2) Since voluntariness comes in degrees, a threshold must be set where personal good reasons are invalidated, leading to peculiar jumps in the justifiability of actions. 3) Anti- paternalism imposes an untenable and unhelpful distinction between the value of respecting choices that are sufficiently voluntary and choices that are not. The third paper adds to this critique the fourth argument that none of the action types typically proposed to specify the action component of paternalism is such that performing an action of that type out of benevolence is essentially morally problematic. The fourth paper ignores the critique in the second and third papers and proposes, in an anti- paternalistic spirit, a series of rules for the justification of option-restricting policies aimed at groups where some members consent to the policy and some do not. Such policies present the liberal with a dilemma where the value of not restricting people's options without their consent conflicts with the value of allowing people to shape their lives according to their own wishes. The fifth paper applies the understanding of anti- paternalism developed in the earlier papers to product safety regulation, as an example of a public health policy area. The sixth paper explores in more detail a specific public health policy, namely that of mandatory alcohol interlocks in all cars, proposed by the former Swedish government and supported by the Swedish National Road Administration. The policy is evaluated for cost-effectiveness, for possible diffusion of individual responsibility, and for paternalistic treatment of drivers. The seventh paper argues for a liberal policy in the area of dissemination of information about uncertain threats to public health. The argument against paternalism is based on common sense consequentialist considerations, avoiding any appeal to the normative anti-paternalism rejected earlier in the thesis.},

Many MPAs embed a no-take zone, aiming to preserve natural populations and ecosystems, within a buffer zone where potentially sustainable activities are allowed. Small-scale fisheries (SSF) within buffer zones can be highly beneficial by promoting local socio-economies. However, guidelines to successfully manage SSFs within MPAs, ensuring both conservation and fisheries goals, and reaching a win-win scenario, are largely unavailable. From the peer-reviewed literature, grey-literature and interviews, we assembled a unique database of ecological, social and economic attributes of SSF in 25 Mediterranean MPAs. Using random forest with Boruta algorithm we identified a set of attributes determining successful SSFs management within MPAs. We show that fish stocks are healthier, fishermen incomes are higher and the social acceptance of management practices is fostered if five attributes are present (i.e. high MPA enforcement, presence of a management plan, fishermen engagement in MPA management, fishermen representative in the MPA board, and promotion of sustainable fishing). These findings are pivotal to Mediterranean coastal communities so they can achieve conservation goals while allowing for profitable exploitation of fisheries resources.},

Understanding how ectothermic species respond to changing temperatures is essential to their conservation and management due to human-altered habitats and changing climates.   * Here, we use two contrasting populations of western pond turtles (Actinemys marmorata) to model the effect of artificial and variable temperature regimes on growth and age at reproductive maturity. The two populations occur on forks of the Trinity River in northern California, U.S.A. The South Fork Trinity River (South Fork) is unregulated, while the main stem of the Trinity River (Main Stem) is dammed and has peak seasonal temperatures that are approximately 10 °C colder than the South Fork.   * Consistent with other studies, we found reduced annual growth rates for turtles in the colder Main Stem compared to the warmer South Fork. The South Fork population matured approximately 9 year earlier, on average, and at a larger body size than the Main Stem population.   * When we normalised growth rates for the thermal opportunity for growth using water-growing degree-days (GDD), we found the reverse for growth rates and age at reproductive maturity. Main Stem turtles grew approximately twice as fast as South Fork turtles per GDD. Main Stem turtles also required approximately 50{\%} fewer GDD to reach their smaller size at reproductive maturity compared to the larger South Fork turtles.   * We found we could accurately hindcast growth rates based on water temperatures estimated from the total volume of discharge from the dam into the Main Stem, providing a management tool for predicting the impacts of the dam on turtle growth rates.   * Given the importance of size and age at reproductive maturity to population dynamics, this information on counter-gradient growth will improve our ability to understand and predict the consequences of dam operations for downstream turtle populations.},

abstract = {Aim The character and distribution of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) populations in New England are analysed to identify the extent to which the introduced chestnut blight and historic land use practices have affected chestnut distribution and life history. Location The study focuses on chestnut in Connecticut and Massachusetts but includes analysis of data related to other Castanea species in North America and Europe. Methods The ecology and palaeoecology of chestnut is investigated using a range of techniques, including examination of the growth form of chestnut trees in plantations located away from blight, mapping of chestnut sprouts and blight-killed trees at various locations, anatomical examination of chestnut stems, analysis of early forestry practices, identification of changes in the relative abundance of chestnut pollen in Holocene lake sediments and comparison of American chestnut with other Castanea species. Results Examination of chestnut sprouts surviving in the former range of that species shows that most sprouts originated from suppressed seedlings and that environmental factors severely limited the survival of sprouts from large blight-killed trees. Palynological data show that chestnut was either present in very low populations or entirely absent from New England and only became abundant after about 2500 years ago. All factors suggest that chestnut abundance is related to the natural disturbance cycle, while human-induced transformations of the landscape and the introduction of chestnut blight have further transformed the character of chestnut in New England. Main conclusions Most surviving chestnut sprouts in New England forests represent old seedlings that have continued to re-sprout since establishment before the introduction of blight nearly 100 years ago. The growth form of these sprouts ensures a minimal substrate of bark tissue for blight establishment so that blight has a relatively minor effect on seedling-sprout survival. The identification of modern chestnut sprouts as old seedlings indicates that the observed distribution of sprouts in New England woodlands is strongly influenced by land use conditions and especially field abandonment at the time when chestnut blight arrived from its point of introduction.},

abstract = {Historical land use (especially agriculture) has seldom been considered in the development of conservation programs for amphibians, a group in global decline. Habitat augmentation (e.g., wetland creation) is a growing conservation strategy to stem population declines in regions affected by habitat loss, but such actions are often implemented indiscriminately of landscape contexts that may mediate conservation outcomes for species with complex life cycles (i.e., distinct larval, juvenile, and adult stages). We examined the contribution of variation in quantity of larval (aquatic) and quality of juvenile/adult (terrestrial) habitat to the distribution of two pool-breeding and forest-dependent amphibian species in upland forest patches with histories that ranged from former agricultural lands (secondary forests) to never having been deforested (legacy forests). Using area-constrained visual encounter surveys in two consecutive years with contrasting precipitation conditions (extreme drought and extreme rainfall), we estimated forest patch occupancy probabilities of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) at a study area in central New York State, USA, and characterized terrestrial microhabitats in 29 population “neighborhoods” (9.3 ha) that varied in larval habitat availability (0–10 constructed vernal pools) and extent of secondary versus legacy forest. Terrestrial amphibian habitat in secondary forests featured shallower leaf litter, denser understory vegetation, and fewer cover object refuges than in legacy forests. The presence of wood frogs was solely affected by breeding pool densities whereas that of the longer-lived and less dispersive spotted salamanders depended on both quantity of larval habitat and quality of terrestrial habitat, with higher levels of occurrence in legacy forests and, during the drought year, where pool densities were greater. These results suggest that larval habitat augmentation can boost populations of amphibians with complex life cycles, but climate variation and land-use legacies mediate conservation outcomes for long-lived habitat specialists.},

abstract = {The crowns of trees and shrubs often overtop temporary wetlands in forested regions. By shading pond basins, canopy can dramatically change the conditions experienced by residents such as amphibians. In this study, we estimated the presence of 8 amphibian species across 17 temporary wetlands at the Yale–Myers Forest in northeastern Connecticut, USA. In addition, we quantified the light environment using a grid of hemispherical canopy photographs to calculate Global Site Factor (GSF) within each wetland. Amphibian richness was low in most wetlands, and most wetlands were relatively shaded. Amphibian richness increased in lighter wetlands. This result was not confounded by relationships with wetland size. Most amphibian species tended to be absent from heavily shaded wetlands (‘open canopy specialists'). However, three species were often found in the shadiest wetlands (‘canopy generalists'). Field transplant experiments using one canopy generalist and one open canopy specialist showed that development of the generalist was less affected by wetland light levels compared with performance of the specialist. These findings suggest that canopy may be an important determinant of amphibian diversity patterns across wetlands. Further, con- servation strategies dependent on universally applied, inviolate shoreline vegetation buffers may inadver- tently contribute to species loss. Because species differ in their sensitivity to changes in canopy, these losses may be predictable.},
annote = {Canopy cover has a significant effect on amphibian diversity and developmental rate. More light availability may allow a wider range of amphibian species to utilize wetland habitats. Light also appears to be directly related to development rate for pool-breeding species. This relationship appears to be stronger for Spring Peepers than other species. Some species may have greater needs for rapid development, which sunlight effectively promotes. The authors in this study suggest that shorline thinning may be a beneficial practice for amphibian larvae. If larval population dynamics are the primary drivers of amphibian populations, then conservation strategies that unilateraly encourage forest regeneration may have negative effects on amphibian diversity and populations in forested ecosystems.},

I consider the setting of the normal mean and highlight the information contained in the p-value in conjunction with the sample size and meaningful effect size. The p-value and sample size jointly yield 95{\%} confidence bounds for the effect of interest, which can be compared to the predetermined meaningful effect size to make inferences about the true effect. I provide simple examples to demonstrate that although the p-value is calculated under the null hypothesis, and thus seemingly may be divorced from the features of the study from which it arises, its interpretation as a measure of evidence requires its contextualization within the study. This implies that any proposal for improved use of the p-value as a measure of the strength of evidence cannot simply be a change to the threshold for significance.},

abstract = {Both observational and experimental studies have documented drastic reductions in salamanders after forest harvesting. Yet, the amount of time until salamander populations rebound and the factors limiting recovery after harvesting are unknown. We compared the effects of six oak regeneration practices to a control, representing a disturbance gradient from no treatment to silvicultural clearcut, on the relative abundance and reproductive demography of terrestrial salamanders through 13-years post-harvest. Following the experimental disturbance, relative abundance of terrestrial salamanders in treatments that opened the canopy were significantly and persistently lower than in either untreated control stands or midstory herbicide treatments. In general, this trend persisted through 9-13 years after treatment. Changes to demography of commonly captured salamanders varied by species, but Plethodon cinereus had a greater proportion of juveniles in unharvested treatments 7-13-years post-harvest, and Desmognathus ochrophaeus had a greater proportion of juveniles and a greater number of eggs/female in unharvested treatments 1-6-years post-harvest. Population modeling of P. cinereus indicated that adult survival had the greatest elasticity of the vital rates. Further, {\textgreater}60 years may be needed before P. cinereus reduced by the observed decline could reach pre-harvest levels of abundance. Of the treatments with canopy disturbance, the group selection harvest had the greatest abundances of salamanders 7-13-years post-harvest, but when coupled with future stand entries, the volume of wood fiber extracted, costs of harvesting, reduced sprouting of oaks, and soil disturbances, this method may not have the best balance of ecological and economic sustainability in central Appalachian hardwood forest. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Increasing UV-B radiation (UV-B; 290-320 nm) due to stratospheric ozone depletion has been a leading explanation for the decline in amphibians for nearly 2 decades. Yet, the likelihood that UV-B can influence amphibians at the large spatial scales relevant to population declines has not yet been evaluated. A key limitation has been in relating results from individual sites to the effect of UV-B for populations distributed across heterogeneous landscapes. We measured critical embryonic exposures to UV-B for two species of montane amphibians with contrasting physiological sensitivities, long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and Cascades frog (Rana cascadae), at field sites spanning a gradient of UV-B attenuation in water. We then used these experimental results to estimate the proportion of embryos exposed to harmful UV-B across a large number of breeding sites. By combining surveys of the incubation timing, incident UV-B, optical transparency of water, and oviposition depth and light exposure of embryos at each site, we present a comprehensive assessment of the risk posed by UV-B for montane amphibians of the Pacific Northwest. We found that only 1.1{\%} of A. macrodactylum and no R. cascadae embryos across a landscape of breeding sites are exposed to UV-B exceeding lethal levels. These results emphasize that accurately estimating the risk posed by environmental stressors requires placing experimental results in a broader ecological context that accounts for the heterogeneity experienced by populations distributed across natural landscapes.},

Little research has been done on what the loss of amphibian species may mean to ecosystem function. I describe a field experiment where the number of Plethodon cinereus (the red-backed salamander) was manipulated in enclosures buried in the forest floor. I determined the composition of the forest floor invertebrate community and the rare of decomposition of leaf litter in enclosures with and without salamanders over 4.5 months. Salamander predation in enclosures significantly reduced invertebrate numbers compared to control enclosures. Salamander predation also indirectly reduced rate of decomposition by between 11 and 17{\%}. This was probably due to salamanders consuming a significant number of leaf fragmenters (e.g. Coleoptera and Diptera larvae). Predation on leaf litter fragmenters may alter carbon dynamics in forested ecosystems.},

abstract = {Reports of rapid growth in nature-based tourism and recreation add significant weight to the economic case for biodiversity conservation but seem to contradict widely voiced concerns that people are becoming increasingly isolated from nature. This apparent paradox has been highlighted by a recent study showing that on a per capita basis, visits to natural areas in the United States and Japan have declined over the last two decades. These results have been cited as evidence of "a fundamental and pervasive shift away from nature-based recreation" - but how widespread is this phenomenon? We address this question by looking at temporal trends in visitor numbers at 280 protected areas (PAs) from 20 countries. This more geographically representative dataset shows that while PA visitation (whether measured as total or per capita visit numbers) is indeed declining in the United States and Japan, it is generally increasing elsewhere. Total visit numbers are growing in 15 of the 20 countries for which we could get data, with the median national rate of change unrelated to the national rate of population growth but negatively associated with wealth. Reasons for this reversal of growth in the richest countries are difficult to pin down with existing data, but the pattern is mirrored by trends in international tourist arrivals as a whole and so may not necessarily be caused by disaffection with nature. Irrespective of the explanation, it is clear that despite important downturns in some countries, nature-related tourism is far from declining everywhere, and may still have considerable potential both to generate funds for conservation and to shape people's attitudes to the environment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Balmford et al.},

abstract = {Abstract: As use of Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) for model selection has become increasingly common, so has a mistake involving interpretation of models that are within 2 AIC units ($\Delta$AIC ≤ 2) of the top-supported model. Such models are {\textless}2 $\Delta$AIC units because the penalty for one additional parameter is +2 AIC units, but model deviance is not reduced by an amount sufficient to overcome the 2-unit penalty and, hence, the additional parameter provides no net reduction in AIC. Simply put, the uninformative parameter does not explain enough variation to justify its inclusion in the model and it should not be interpreted as having any ecological effect. Models with uninformative parameters are frequently presented as being competitive in the Journal of Wildlife Management, including 72{\%} of all AIC-based papers in 2008, and authors and readers need to be more aware of this problem and take appropriate steps to eliminate misinterpretation. I reviewed 5 potential solutions to this problem: 1) report all models but ignore or dismiss those with uninformative parameters, 2) use model averaging to ameliorate the effect of uninformative parameters, 3) use 95{\%} confidence intervals to identify uninformative parameters, 4) perform all-possible subsets regression and use weight-of-evidence approaches to discriminate useful from uninformative parameters, or 5) adopt a methodological approach that allows models containing uninformative parameters to be culled from reported model sets. The first approach is preferable for small sets of a priori models, whereas the last 2 approaches should be used for large model sets or exploratory modeling.},

abstract = {Changes of the land surface affect the water balance components over seasonal, annual and decadal time scales. This study explored the role of vegetation cover transitions on evapotranspiration in forested watersheds of the North American West. We applied empirical time-recovery functions describing the impact of forest removal and subsequent regrowth on actual evapotranspiration (AET) or runoff. A generalized function (K-curve) was adapted to the North American West and tested using three different datasets of observed or estimated AET in forest chronosequences: AET from flux towers equipped with eddy covariance sensors, AET estimated from the water balance in experimental paired watersheds and in a set of gauged watersheds with considerable forest cover history dating back to the 18th century. AET from the first two datasets showed a behaviour similar to the K-curve, although the timing and the magnitude differed substantially. To reconstruct long-term changes in AET for the gauged watersheds, we applied a transfer function approach linking the K-curve and the reconstructed forest cover history at the watershed scale. In several watersheds, correlation coefficients between the reconstructed AET changes and the annual water balances suggest that changes in time were driven by the land cover transitions. In watersheds with low correlations, disturbance activities peaked before the 20th century, and the effects of vegetation have phased out in the period of streamflow observations. The findings of this paper suggest that trends in the observed water balance in forested watersheds can be associated to land cover disturbances well before the start of hydro-climatic observations. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Global-scale environmental problems are rarely regarded as amenable to traditional scientific experiment. We argue here that small-scale experiments using 'model organisms' in microcosms or mesocosms can be a useful approach for apparently intractable global problems, such as ecosystem responses to climate change or managing biodiversity through the design of nature reserves. An experimental, small-scale research programme can easily be coupled with the development of theory and act as a stimulus to further research, thereby hastening both understanding of the issues and development of practical solutions. This process - from microcosm experiment to the development of practical application - has previously been influential but also has a long time lag. We suggest short-cuts in an attempt to stimulate the use of small-scale experiments to address globally urgent issues with meaningful policy implications. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

There is, however, no consensus on acceptable alternatives, leaving researchers with little choice but to continue using NHST, regardless of its failings. I examine the potential for the Analysis of Credibility (AnCred) to resolve this impasse. Using real-life examples, I assess the ability of AnCred to provide researchers with a simple but robust framework for assessing study findings that goes beyond the standard dichotomy of statistical significance/nonsignificance. By extracting more insight from standard summary statistics while offering more protection against inferential fallacies, AnCred may encourage researchers to move toward the post p {\textless} 0.05 era.

abstract = {Both observational and experimental studies have documented drastic reductions in salamanders after forest harvesting. Yet, the amount of time until salamander populations rebound and the factors limiting recovery after harvesting are unknown. We compared the effects of six oak regeneration practices to a control, representing a disturbance gradient from no treatment to silvicultural clearcut, on the relative abundance and reproductive demography of terrestrial salamanders through 13-years post-harvest. Following the experimental disturbance, relative abundance of terrestrial salamanders in treatments that opened the canopy were significantly and persistently lower than in either untreated control stands or midstory herbicide treatments. In general, this trend persisted through 9-13 years after treatment. Changes to demography of commonly captured salamanders varied by species, but Plethodon cinereus had a greater proportion of juveniles in unharvested treatments 7-13-years post-harvest, and Desmognathus ochrophaeus had a greater proportion of juveniles and a greater number of eggs/female in unharvested treatments 1-6-years post-harvest. Population modeling of P. cinereus indicated that adult survival had the greatest elasticity of the vital rates. Further, {\textgreater}60 years may be needed before P. cinereus reduced by the observed decline could reach pre-harvest levels of abundance. Of the treatments with canopy disturbance, the group selection harvest had the greatest abundances of salamanders 7-13-years post-harvest, but when coupled with future stand entries, the volume of wood fiber extracted, costs of harvesting, reduced sprouting of oaks, and soil disturbances, this method may not have the best balance of ecological and economic sustainability in central Appalachian hardwood forest. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Drought is a strong density-independent environmental filter that contributes to population regulation and other ecological processes. Not all species respond similarly to drought, and the overall impacts can vary depending on life histories. Such differences can necessitate management strategies that incorporate information on individual species to maximize conservation success. We report the effects of a short-term drought on occupancy and reproductive success of two pond-breeding salamanders that differ in breeding phenology (fall vs. spring breeder) across an active military base landscape in Missouri, USA. We surveyed {\~{}}200 ponds for the presence of eggs, larvae, and metamorphs from 2011 to 2013. This period coincided with before, during, and after a severe drought that occurred in 2012. The two species showed contrasting responses to drought, where high reproductive failure (34{\%} of ponds) was observed for the spring breeder during a single drought year. Alternatively, the fall breeder only showed a cumulative 8{\%} failure over two years. The number of breeding ponds available for use in the fall decreased during the drought due to pond drying and/or a lack of re-filling. Estimates of occupancy probability declined for the fall-breeding salamander between 2012 and 2013, whereas occupancy probability estimates of the spring breeder increased post-drought. The presence of fish, hydroperiod, the amount of forest cover surrounding ponds, and canopy cover were all found to affect estimates of occupancy probabilities of each species. Pond clustering (distance to nearest pond and the number of ponds within close proximity), hydroperiod, forest cover, and canopy cover influenced both estimates of colonization and extinction probabilities. Our results show life history variation can be important in determining the relative susceptibility of a species to drought conditions, and that sympatric species experiencing the same environmental conditions can respond differently. Consideration of the spatial network and configuration of habitat patches that act as refuges under extreme environmental conditions will improve conservation efforts, such as the placement of permanent ponds for aquatic organisms. A better awareness of species-specific tolerances to environmental filters such as drought can lead to improved management recommendations to conserve and promote habitat for a greater diversity of species across landscapes of spatially connected populations.},

abstract = {The Sierra Nevada of California is one of many regions worldwide that has recently experienced dramatic declines in amphibian populations. During the past two to three decades many populations of at least two species (Rana muscosa and Bufo canorus) have disappeared in national parks and designated wilderness areas at high elevation, whereas populations of a third widespread species (Pseudacris regilla) have remained stable or declined to a lesser extent. Acidification from atmospheric deposition has been suggested as a cause for these disappearances primarily because most surface waters in these areas are exceptionally low in acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and thus are vulnerable to changes in water chemistry due to acidic deposition. We tested the hypothesis that acidification of habitats has adversely affected amphibian populations by eliminating populations from waters most vulnerable to acidification, i.e. low in pH or ANC, or from waters low in ionic strength, a condition that increases the sensitivity of amphibians to low pH. A survey of 235 potential breeding sites in 30 randomly selected survey areas failed to reveal significant differences in water chemistry parameters between sites with and sites without each of the three species. Moreover, the water chemistry parameters did not differ among sites inhabited by the three species in a manner paralleling their degrees of acid tolerance. These findings contra-indicate acidic deposition as a cause of recent amphibian population declines in the Sierra Nevada at high elevation. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Large herbivores are generally facing dramatic population declines and range contractions, such that ∼60{\%} are threatened with extinction. Nearly all threatened species are in developing countries, where major threats include hunting, land-use change, and resource depression by livestock. Loss of large herbivores can have cascading effects on other species including large carnivores, scavengers, mesoherbivores, small mammals, and ecological processes involving vegetation, hydrology, nutrient cycling, and fire regimes.

abstract = {The present note explores sources of misplaced criticisms of P-values, such as conflicting definitions of "sig-nificance levels" and "P-values" in authoritative sources, and the consequent misinterpretation of P-values as error probabilities. It then discusses several properties of P-values that have been presented as fatal flaws: That P-values exhibit extreme variation across samples (and thus are "unreliable"), confound effect size with sample size, are sensitive to sample size, and depend on investigator sampling intentions. These properties are often criticized from a likelihood or Bayesian framework, yet they are exactly the properties P-values should exhibit when they are constructed and interpreted correctly within their originating framework. Other common criticisms are that P-values force users to focus on irrelevant hypotheses and overstate evidence against those hypotheses. These problems are not however properties of P-values but are faults of researchers who focus on null hypotheses and overstate evidence based on misperceptions that p = 0.05 represents enough evidence to reject hypotheses. Those problems are easily seen without use of Bayesian concepts by translating the observed P-value p into the Shannon information (S-value or surprisal) −log 2 (p). ARTICLE HISTORY},

In the towns where print imagery was used, 77.4 {\%} of sur- veyed PVPs were confirmed as compared to 60.8{\%} of PVPs surveyed in the towns with digital photography. The higher commission errors using the digitalmethod were likely due to enhanced ability to detect smaller features. Omission errors were common using both print and digital methods. Only 43{\%}of confirmed vernal pools were located in areas mapped by NWI, suggesting that NWI information does not improve detection accuracy.Aerial photo interpretation continues to be effective for PVP identification in our region and is improved with the use of digital stereoplotters.},

abstract = {Today, most ecosystems show some degree of human modification, ranging from subtle influences to complete remodeling and reshaping into anthropogenic ecosystems. In the first issue of the journal Ecosystems, the field of historical ecology, which focuses on the historical development of ecosystems, was prominently positioned with the papers of Foster and others (Ecosystems 1:96–119, 1998) and Fuller and others (Ecosystems 1:76–95, 1998). Starting from these two contributions, we (1) discuss how anthropogenic activities affect ecosystems and their development, (2) outline how land use can be assessed in ecosystem research, and we (3) discuss what the consequences of a historical perspective for our understanding of ecosystems are. We conclude by stating that whereas land-use intensity over time is an ecologically highly relevant parameter to grasp, the availability, quality, and characteristics of historical sources often restrict the analyses. In order to make optimal use of the sources and methods available and to strengthen this field of research and also increase its societal relevance, we suggest building interdisciplinary teams from a very early project phase on. Core task for these teams will be to jointly define research questions considering source availability, and including and merging modeling and experimental approaches in the study design. We propose that adopting a landscape perspective in historical ecology would provide a helpful framework and valuable background for such novel integrated analyses.},

In this study, we aim to map recreation supply, demand, and flow, combining different approaches and data sources, including spatially explicit indicators and crowd-sourced information from social media. We analyse spatial and temporal patterns in the European Alps and their surrounding areas (Alpine Space area) and explore societal preferences. Our results indicate that especially mountainous areas provide high ecosystem service supply, while high demand is characteristic of strongly urbanised areas. The spatio-temporal pattern of flow hot spots shows two major trends: recreational landscapes around urban agglomerations are frequented all year round, whereas visitation rates in remote mountain areas depend greatly on the season. By means of a cluster analysis, we identify five types of municipalities, distinguishing municipalities with little importance for recreation, prevailing demand, or supply, and highly used areas. Further, our results suggest that societal preferences can be explained by landscape attributes and tourism infrastructure. In addition to revealing a large-scale spatio-temporal pattern, this study explores methodological possibilities to provide a basis for decision-making and landscape planning regarding recreational ecosystem services.},

Modes of winter seed movement, snow conditions required for seed deposition, and seed fall were examined using a variety of selective seed traps in Delaware, USA, during winter and autumn of 1985. Conditions required for seed release were identified by subjecting catkins to experimental temperature and humidity treatments. In natural populations, seed was released preferentially on days with high winds and below-fr eezing temperatures. Catkins held in experimental environments released seed at low humidity, regardless of temperature. Through secondary dispersal across a smooth snow surface, seeds in a natural population were distributed over an area 3.3 times greate r than the area covered by aerial dispersal alone. Large numbers of seeds accumulated in experimental indentations in the snow, and in shallow depressions corresponding to the bases of uprooted trees. By contrast, emergent shrub and herb stems had a relat ively minor effect on seed deposition, and very few seeds were deposited on the smooth snow surface. Daily control of seed release during an autumn-winter dispersal period appears to promote long-range secondary dispersal by wind across a snow surface. Th rough this mechanism, 'passive' dispersal by wind produces non-random, aggregated seed distributions, and increases the chances of seeds arriving in suitable regeneration sites.},

abstract = {Spatial subsidies are resources transferred from one ecosystem to another and which can greatly affect recipient systems. Increased subsidy quantity is known to increase these effects, but subsidy quality is likely also important. We examined the effects of leaf litter quality (varying in nutrient and tannin content) in pond mesocosms on gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) biomass export, as well as water quality and ecosystem processes. We used litter from three different tree species native to Missouri [white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum)], one non-native tree [white pine (Pinus strobus)], and a common aquatic grass [prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata)]. We found that leaf litter species affected almost every variable we measured. Gray treefrog biomass export was greatest in mesocosms with grass litter and lowest with white oak litter. Differences in biomass export were affected by high tannin concentrations (or possibly the correlated variable, dissolved oxygen) via their effects on survival, and by primary production, which altered mean body mass. Effects of litter species could often be traced back to the characteristics of the litter itself: leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, and tannin content, which highlights the importance of plant functional traits in affecting aquatic ecosystems. This work and others stress that changes in forest species composition could greatly influence aquatic systems and aquatic-terrestrial linkages.},

abstract = {—Florida scrub is a fire-maintained ecosystem with a high concentration of endemic and imperiled species. To assist in the conservation of these taxa, we evaluated how communities and populations of amphibians and reptiles varied with fire history in rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides) scrub. We calculated species richness, evenness, total abundance, and individual species abundance for all amphibians and reptiles captured from May through August 2003 and May 2004 at 12 rosemary scrub sites in Highlands County, Florida, that differed in fire history (time since last fire, TSF). Vegetation structure (bare ground and canopy cover) varied polynomially with TSF, with intermediate TSF sites most open and long-unburned sites least open. Species richness, evenness, and total abundance did not vary with fire history. At the species level, only two species, Plestiodon reynoldsi and Aspidoscelis sexlineata, showed significant relationships with TSF: P. reynoldsi was most common in least open, longest-unburned areas and least common in most open, intermediately burned areas, whereas A. sexlineata was most common in most open and intermediately burned areas and least common in recently and long-unburned areas. The close relationship of abundance to vegetation structure suggests that indirect fire-induced changes may be more important than fire per se. In sum, amphibian and reptile communities did not vary with fire history; however abundances of some species did},

One way to improve the practice of statistics and resolve these issues is to do what initiators of the 2016 ASA statement did: take one issue at a time, have extensive discussions about the issue among statisticians of diverse backgrounds and perspectives and eventually develop and publish a broadly supported consensus on that issue. Upon completion of this task, we then move on to deal with another core issue in the same way. We propose as the next project a process that might lead quickly to a strong consensus that the term “statistically significant” and all its cognates and symbolic adjuncts be disallowed in the scientific literature except where focus is on the history of statistics and its philosophies and methodologies.

abstract = {Aim Understanding the scales over which land use affects animal populations is critical for conservation planning, and it can provide information about the mechanisms that underlie correlations between species distributions and land use. We used a citizen science database of anuran surveys to examine the rela- tionship between road density, land use and the distribution of frogs and toads across spatial scales and regions of the United States. Location Eastern and Central United States. Methods We compiled data on anuran occupancy collected from 1999 to 2013 across 13 states in the North American Amphibian Monitoring Program, a citi- zen science survey of calling frogs. These data were indexed to measures of land use within buffers ranging from 300 m to 10 km. Results The negative effects of road density and development on anuran rich- ness were strongest at the smallest scales (300–1000 m), and this pattern was consistent across regions. In contrast, the relationships of anuran richness to agriculture and forest cover were similar across local scales but varied among regions. Richness had a negative relationship with agriculture/forest loss in the Midwest but a positive relationship with agriculture in the Northeast. Anuran richness was more closely related to primary/secondary road density than to rural road density, and the negative effects of larger roads increased at smaller scales. Individual species differed in the scales over which roads and develop- ment affected their distributions, but these differences were not closely related to either body size or movement ability. Main conclusions This study further refines our understanding of the relation- ship between roads and amphibian populations and highlights the need for research into the specific mechanisms by which roads affect amphibians. Addi- tionally, we find that relationships between land use and species richness can differ substantially across regions, demonstrating that one should use caution in generalizing from one region to another, even when species composition is similar. 158},

Agriculture carried slight benefits for species richness in the NE and SE but had strong negative impacts on richness in the MW, where industrial soy and corn farms are widespread. Forest cover showed the opposite pattern, having slight negative effects on richness in the NE and SE and strong positive effects in the MW (likely in contrast to the strong negative impacts of agriculture in this region). Primary/secondary roads with impervious surface cover and surrounding development seemed to have a stronger effect on amphibians than less developed rural roads.

abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category-subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods - both sample-based and individual-based - allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

abstract = {Abstract Compassionate conservation focuses on 4 tenets: first, do no harm; individuals matter; inclusivity of individual animals; and peaceful coexistence between humans and animals. Recently, compassionate conservation has been promoted as an alternative to conventional conservation philosophy. We believe examples presented by compassionate conservationists are deliberately or arbitrarily chosen to focus on mammals; inherently not compassionate; and offer ineffective conservation solutions. Compassionate conservation arbitrarily focuses on charismatic species, notably large predators and megaherbivores. The philosophy is not compassionate when it leaves invasive predators in the environment to cause harm to vastly more individuals of native species or uses the fear of harm by apex predators to terrorize mesopredators. Hindering the control of exotic species (megafauna, predators) in situ will not improve the conservation condition of the majority of biodiversity even if compassionate conservationists do no harm to individuals of the exotic species. The positions taken by so-called compassionate conservationists on particular species and on conservation actions could be extended to hinder other forms of conservation, including translocations, conservation fencing, and fertility control. Animal welfare is incredibly important to conservation, but ironically compassionate conservation does not offer the best welfare outcomes to animals and is often ineffective in achieving conservation goals. Consequently, compassionate conservation may threaten public and governmental support for conservation because of the general publics? limited understanding of conservation problems.

abstract = {Habitat destruction and fragmentation have been identified as possible causes of large-scale amphibian declines. Here, we examine the effects of adjacent land use and water quality on wetland amphibian species richness, abundance, and community composition in 74 Ontario wetlands. Species richness was positively correlated with wetland area, forest cover, and the amount of wetlands on adjacent lands and negatively correlated with road density and nitrogen levels. The land-use effects peak at 2000-3000 m. Amphibian abundance was positively correlated with forest cover, distance to wetlands {\textgreater}20 ha, and amount of marsh habitat and negatively correlated with road density. The effects of adjacent land use were strongest at around 200 m. Land-use and water quality effects varied widely across species, although most species are positively correlated with forest cover and amount of wetlands on adjacent lands and negatively correlated with road density and water quality. These results suggest that the effects of adjacent land use on amphibian communities can extend over comparatively large distances. As such, effective wetland conservation will not be achieved merely through the creation of narrow buffer zones between wetlands and intensive land uses, but rather will require maintaining a heterogeneous regional landscape containing relatively large areas of natural forest and wetlands.},

abstract = {Forest harvest operations often produce large amounts of harvest residue which typically becomes fine (foliage, small limbs and trees) and coarse woody debris (snags and downed logs). If removed at harvest, residual biomass has potential to be a local energy source and to produce marketable biofuel feedstock. But, CWD in particular serves critical life-history functions (e.g., breeding, foraging, basking) for a variety of organisms. Unfortunately, little is known about how forest biodiversity would respond to large scale removal of harvest residues. We calculated 745 biodiversity effect sizes from 26 studies involving manipulations of CWD (i.e., removed or added downed woody debris and/or snags). Diversity and abundance of both cavity- and open-nesting birds were substantially and consistently lower in treatments with lower amounts of downed CWD and/or standing snags, as was biomass of invertebrates. However, cumulative effect sizes for other taxa were not as large, were based on fewer studies, and varied among manipulation types. Little is currently known about biodiversity response to harvest of fine woody debris. Predicting the effects of biomass harvests on forest biodiversity is uncertain at best until more is known about how operational harvests actually change fine and coarse woody debris levels over long time periods. Pilot biomass harvests report post-harvest changes in CWD levels much smaller than the experimental changes involved in the studies we analyzed. Thus, operational biomass harvests may not change CWD levels enough to appreciably influence forest biodiversity, especially when following biomass harvest guidelines that require leaving a portion of harvest residues. Multi-scale studies can help reduce this uncertainty by investigating how biodiversity responses scale from the small scale of manipulative experiments (i.e., 10-ha plots) to operational forest management and how biodiversity response to CWD levels might vary at different spatial and temporal scales and in different landscape contexts. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present data on amphibian density, species richness, and diversity from a 7140-ha area consisting of 200 ponds in the Midwestern U.S. that represents most of the possible lentic aquatic breeding habitats common in this region. Our study includes all possible breeding sites with natural and anthropogenic disturbance processes that can be missing from studies where sampling intensity is low, sample area is small, or partial disturbance gradients are sampled.We tested whether pond area was a significant predictor of density, species richness, and diversity of amphibians and if values peaked at intermediate pond areas. We found that in all cases a quadratic model fit our data significantly better than a linear model. Because small ponds have a high probability of pond drying and large ponds have a high probability of fish colonization and accumulation of invertebrate predators, drying and pre- dationmay be two mechanisms driving the peak of density and diversity towards intermediate values of pond size. We also found that not all intermediate sized ponds producedmany larvae; in fact, some had low amphibian density, richness, and diversity. Further analyses of the subset of ponds represented in the peak of the area distribution showed that fish, hydroperiod, invertebrate density, and canopy are additional factors that drive density, richness and diversity of ponds up or down, when extremely small or large ponds are eliminated. Our results indicate that fishless ponds at intermediate sizes aremore diverse, produce more larvae, and have greater potential to recruit juveniles into adult populations of most species sampled. Further, hylid and chorus frogs are found predictably more often in ephemeral ponds whereas bullfrogs, green frogs, and cricket frogs are found most often in permanent ponds with fish. Our data increase understanding of what factors structure and maintain amphibian diversity across large landscapes.},

abstract = {Contemporary Western attitudes concerning the management of natural resources, treatment of nonhuman animals, and the natural world emerge from traditions derived from Western European philosophy, i.e., they assume that humans are autonomous from, and in control of, the natural world. A different approach is presented by Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of indigenous peoples of North America. Although spiritually oriented, TEK converges on Western scientific approaches. TEK is based on close observation of nature and natural phenomena; however, it is combined with a concept of community membership that differs from that of Western political and social thought. TEK is strongly tied to specific physical localities; therefore, all aspects of the physical space can be considered part of the community, including animals, plants, and landforms. As a consequence, native worldviews can be considered to be spatially oriented, in contrast to the temporal orientation of Western political and historical thought. TEK also emphasizes the idea that individual plants and animals exist on their own terms. This sense of place and concern for individuals leads to two basic TEK concepts: (1) all things are connected, which is conceptually related to Western community ecology, and (2) all things are related, which changes the emphasis from the human to the ecological community as the focus of theories concerning nature. Connectedness and relatedness are involved in the clan systems of many indigenous peoples, where nonhuman organisms are recognized as relatives whom the humans are obliged to treat with respect and honor. Convergence of TEK and Western science suggests that there may be areas in which TEK can contribute insights, or possibly even new concepts, to Western science. TEK is inherently multidisciplinary in that it links the human and the nonhuman, and is the basis not only for indigenous concepts of nature, but also for concepts of indigenous politics and ethics. This multidisciplinary aspect suggests that TEK may be useful in resolving conflicts involving a variety of stakeholders and interest groups in controversies over natural resource use, animal rights, and conservation. TEK may also have implications for human behavior and obligations toward other forms of life that are often unrecognized, or at least not emphasized, in Western science. We present examples from community and behavioral ecology where a TEK-based approach yielded unexpected and nonintuitive insights into natural phenomena. Understanding of TEK may be useful in helping scientists respond to the changing public perceptions of science, and new cultural pressures in our society.},

abstract = {One of the major effects of deforestation is the creation of numerous edge zones where remaining forest meets nonforest habitat. At this interface, edge effects on forest habitats can include altered abiotic conditions, changes in rates of competition and predation, and altered community structure. While the edge effects resulting from clear-cuts and other open habitats are well-studied, little is known about the comparative edge effects of forest roads. We studied the effects of forest roads on the abundance, surface activity, and body condition of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) and slimy salamanders (P. glutinosus and P. cylindraceus) in the Southern Appalachians of Virginia. We conducted surveys for salamanders at 21 sites where gravel roads bisected mature forest. These sites were divided into three data sets based on region and year of survey. We also carried out an enclosure experiment to determine whether road edges influenced the surface activity and detectability of red-backed salamanders. We found fewer red-backed salamanders near roads in all three data sets. These edge effects extended {\textless}20 m into the forest in two of the three data sets but increased linearly out to 80 m in the data set collected during an unusually dry period. In contrast, slimy salamanders showed no clear responses to forest-road edges and had significantly different responses than those of red-backed salamanders. Within our experimental enclosures, red-backed salamander detectability did not differ between edge and interior habitats, suggesting that the patterns we observed were not simply due to changes in salamander activity patterns. Like red-backed salamander counts, soil moisture and cover object area also tended to decrease near roads. The steepness of the gradient in soil moisture was a significant predictor of the steepness of the decline in salamander counts, while there was no significant relationship between the decreases in cover object area and decreases in salamander counts. Collectively, these results show that edge effects from forest roads may be comparable to edge effects from clear-cuts or other types of silvicultural edges. Additionally, they suggest that, for terrestrial salamanders, variation in the magnitude of edge effects may be related to variation in soil moisture. Management approaches that minimize soil desiccation associated with road building and maintenance may reduce the impacts of roads on amphibian populations in adjacent forest.},

The direct and indirect responses of amphibians to these disturbances are poorly studied, especially in regards to the larval life stage and seasonally inundated wetlands. Sampling was conducted in 22 medium-sized (0.12-0.39 ha) seasonal ponds that ranged in both TSF ({\textless} 4 mo, 1-2 yr, 3-5 yr, and 13 yr) and proportion rooted by feral hogs (range 0-0.85 of pond area). From April to September, 2014, I collected data on presence/absence of plant genera, total vegetation cover, primary production (chlorophyll-a), water depth, pH, conductivity, ortho-P, total-P, nitrate, ammonium, and total-N. Recently burned ponds had slightly higher pH and ortho-P, but the differences were not statistically significant. I used a combination of night-time call surveys, dipnetting, and funnel trapping to estimate species richness of calling anurans, anuran calling intensity, diversity and abundance of larval amphibians, growth and development of larval Pinewoods Treefrogs (Hyla femoralis), diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrates, and fish presence. Failure of some ponds to fill and differences in filling date for remaining ponds (n = 17) posed some challenges for statistical analyses. Nevertheless, my study yielded useful preliminary data on interrelationships between fire, hog rooting, and pond hydroperiod, as well as abiotic and biotic changes resulting from these disturbances. TSF and rooting had no significant effects on water chemistry, nutrients, or adult and larval amphibian diversity and abundance, although ponds with intermediate levels of rooting tended to have higher abundance of larval H. femoralis. TSF and rooting had significant effects on predatory macroinvertebrate abundance and macroinvertebrate evenness; specifically, abundance of predatory macroinvertebrates varied significantly with TSF and macroinvertebrate evenness was inversely related to proportion rooted. More research is needed to understand the interactions between fire, hog rooting, and amphibians in seasonal ponds. Future studies should use a much larger sample size or focus on only one predictor variable, controlling for either fire or rooting.},

abstract = {The American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once an integral part of eastern US deciduous forests, with many environmental, economic, and social values. This ended with the introduction of an invasive fungal pathogen that wiped out over three billion trees. Transgenic American chestnuts expressing a gene for oxalate oxidase successfully tolerate infections by this blight fungus, but potential non-target environmental effects should be evaluated before new restoration material is released. Two greenhouse bioassays evaluated belowground interactions between transgenic American chestnuts and neighboring organisms found in their native ecosystems. Potential allelopathy was tested by germinating several types of seeds, all native to American chestnut habitats, in the presence of chestnut leaf litter. Germination was not significantly different in terms of number of seeds germinated or total biomass of germinated seedlings in transgenic and non-transgenic leaf litter. Separately, ectomycorrhizal associations were observed on transgenic and non-transgenic American chestnut roots using field soil inoculum. Root tip colonization was consistently high ({\textgreater}90{\%} colonization) on all plants and not significantly different between any tree types. These observations on mycorrhizal fungi complement previous studies performed on older transgenic lines which expressed oxalate oxidase at lower levels. Along with other environmental impact comparisons, these conclusions provide further evidence that transgenic American chestnuts are not functionally different with regard to ecosystem interactions than non-transgenic American chestnuts.},

abstract = {Experimental studies of complex life cycles in plethodontid salamanders are reviewed and evaluated in the context of seven theoretical life-history models that focus on amphibians having biphasic life cycles. Such life cycles are found in the single species of the subfamily Hemidactylinae and in some members of the subfamily Spelerpinae and genus Desmognathus. In general, data on plethodontids provide only limited support for the predictions of the models. Given that the models have been formulated mainly for pond-breeding amphibians, several investigators have suggested that ancestral adaptation to streams in biphasic plethodontids have prescribed different evolutionary trajectories in the metamorphic response of these salamanders, in comparison with pond-breeding frogs and salamanders. Larval and metamorpbic characters tabulated for biphasic plethodontids show that there is considerable inter- and intraspecific variation in larval periods and sizes at metamorphosis. In all lineages, in most species, metamorphosis is concentrated in the late spring and summer. However, spelerpines and desmognathans differ markedly in the phenology of oviposition-nesting. Among spelerpine species, oviposition may occur in any season, whereas in desmognathans oviposition is usually restricted to late spring and summer. This represents another instance of life-history symmetry in desmognathans, and may reflect an effect of genetic and developmental constraints in this lineage.},
annote = {A review of theories of complex life cycles in amphibians with applications for metamorphosing plethodontids. Some key points - stream-breeding is the ancestral life history mode for all plethodontids. Major life history models for biphasic pond-breeding amphibians do not apply well to plethodontids, which are evolutionarily adapted to less productive but more hydrologically reliable lotic habitats than the lentic habitats the models were designed for. Stream-breeding plethodontids can more affordably adhere to a metamorphic schedule that optimizes the timing of entry into upland habitats.

Most theoretical life-history models have been made for pond-breeding amphibians

CLC life history models for amphibians:
- Wilbur and Collins (1973) - any biphasic species has a lower and upper limit of body size that is evolutionarily determined which will allow for metamorphosis; small and fast growing larvae should delay metamorphosis to take advantage of the growth opportunities of aquatic habitat and large/slow growing larvae should metamorphose immediately

- Smith-Gill and Berven (1979) - timing of metamorphosis a function of differentiation rate (e.g. from temperature differences) whereas body size at metamorphosis is a function of both growth and differentiation rates; density is also a determinant of size - larvae in high-density conditions will always be smaller

- Werner (1986) - extends model to adult phase: optimal size at metamorphosis is that size where the ratio curve of mortality rate to absolute growth rate is lower in the terrestrial stage than the aquatic stage

- Rowe and Ludwig (1991) - growth rates and mortality rates are defined in terms of future reproductive output; intermediate body size is the optimum for metamorphosis; each individulal much reach a critical body size by a specific time to reproduce

- Denver (1997, 2002) - emphasis only on larval ecology; neuroendocrine mechanism controling metamorphic timing; timing plasticity as an adpative response to the mortality risk of pond drying - hydrologic uncertainty (more relevant in VP species)

- Hentschel (1999) - food availability is the biggest determinant of size and age at metamorphosis; two phased larval period (a. resource-dependent growth and b. resource-independent growth)

- Day and Rowe (2002) - age at maturity, what is the optimal age that maximizes lifetime reproductive success (assumes fecundity increases with body size)

- body size and age are important metamorphic parameters, which are acted on by temperature, food resources, hydroperiod, and predation

- "switching curves" - reaction norms for growth rates with different rules dependent on env conditions

Plethodontidae (375 sp) is 70{\%} of all salamander species (550 sp)
- lungless, breathing through skin and mouth lining
- low metabolic rates and low energy reqs
- dominated by direct development Plethodontinae and Bolitoglossinae
- Desmognathus (Plethodontinae) contains mainy metamorphosing species

abstract = {Amphibian abundance and species richness was examined in stands of natural, mixed-species forest and in a chronosequence of black spruce (Picea mariana) plantations up to 16-years old in southern New Brunswick, Canada, during 1993 and 1994. Seven species of amphibians were studied in 64 terrestrial sites of 10+ ha, and at 16 ephemeral ponds. Eggs, larvae, and adult numbers were estimated using a variety of sampling methods (visual pond surveys, night calling, pit-fall traps, and searches of coarse-woody debris). The low abundance of woody angiosperm vegetation in conifer plantations, particularly those with incomplete canopy closure, resulted in less leaf litter and drier coarse-woody debris than in natural forest. Amphibians were more abundant in natural forest than in plantations of any age. The most common terrestrial amphibian in natural forest was the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus), but it occurred in only one of 33 plantations examined. Amphibians bred in all study ponds, including those in plantations, but only small numbers of American toad (Bufo americanus), yellow-spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), and red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) were observed in terrestrial habitats of plantations outside of the breeding season. The densities of A. maculatum and wood frog (Rana sylvatica) breeding in ponds within plantations were most strongly related to the distance to the nearest natural forest. For spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) and A. maculatum, the high exposure and short hydroperiod of plantation ponds resulted in poor recruitment in both study years. This study suggests that the conversion of natural, mixed-species forest into conifer plantations is most detrimental to A maculatum, P. cinereus, P. crucifer, and R. sylvatica, and less-so for B. americanus.},
annote = {A fantastic, comprehensive study of amphibian-habitat relationships in natural forests and recently established conifer stands (open, partial canopy, and closed canopy) in New Brunswick. The researchers utilized mutliple sampling approaches to target species at all life cycles - including call surveys, egg mass counts, larval counts, and terrestrial surveys/trapping. They found multiple important effects of young conifer stands on amphibian habitats, breeding activity, recruitment, and upland activity. 

Habitat findings: More decayed wood in closed-canopy plantations and natural forests. Natural forests were more humid and contained greater amounts of leaf litter than all conifer types. More pools were found in conifer stands than natural forests - likely a result of vehicle movement and human activity. Water chemistry was similar across all pools. Pools in open and partial-canopy plantations dried more quickly than others, and contained less aquatic vegetation.

Amphibian findings: Habitat type did not affect breeding activity/calling behavior. Egg mass densities were strongly influenced by habitat type for both wood frogs and spotted salamanders - with greater densities found in pools closer to natural forests. Overall, occupancy and abundance of all amphibian species was greater in natural forests than all types of conifer stands. Additionally, trapping data from six pools revealed more amphibians moving toward natural forests than conifer stands, implying they prefer natural mixed-species forests than young conifer plantations.

VES surveys conducted during high humidity periods following a rainfall lasting {\textgreater}8 hrs - 1 plot in each of 64 sites, surveyed once. Pitfall traps were also established in 14 sites and checked every three days in 1993.

Call surveys were conducted weekly in both summers. 

5-10 person-hours per plot (10m x 10m)

This study did everything - all my methods, many of my questions, and more.

Habitat:
- More decayed wood in closed-canopy plantations and natural forests
- Greater abundance of litter in natural forests than plantations
- Natural forests more humid at ground surface than plantations

Amphibians:
- 93{\%} of natural forests contained amphibians compared with 15{\%} of plantations
- Greater numbers of red-backeds, spotted salamanders, eastern-red newts, spring peepers, and wood frogs found and/or captured in natural forests
- More amphibians were caught moving toward natural forests
- Capture rates affected by breeding season for wood frogs 
- 
- Density of egg masses of spotted salamanders strongly influenced by distance to natural forest (r2 = 0.39)

Here, we conduct one of the first comprehensive tests of Elinor Ostrom's diagnostic framework for analyzing social-ecological systems to examine how 16 socioeconomic and institutional conditions are related the livelihood outcomes in 42 co-management arrangements in five countries across the Indo-Pacific. We combine recent developments in both theory and modeling to address three key challenges among comparative studies of social-ecological systems: the presence of a large number of explanatory mechanisms, variables operating at multiple scales, and the potential for interactions among socio-economic and institutional factors. We find that resource users were more likely to perceive benefits from co-management when they are more involved in decisions, were aware that humans are causal agents of change in marine systems, were wealthier, were not migrants, were in villages with smaller populations and older co-management arrangements, and had clearly established boundaries. Critically, we quantify a number of key interactions between: wealth, dependence on marine resources, involvement in decision-making, and population size that have strong implications for co-management success in terms of livelihood benefits. This study demonstrates that context plays a critical but identifiable role in co-management success. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Visual flyout count data for the common bent-wing bat Miniopterus schreibersii, collected by a team of observers over two seasons at a disused mine in the Kinglake National Park, south-eastern Australia, was compared with infra-red video footage, collected simultaneously, in order to quantify the precision and accuracy of the observer counts. Bayesian statistical models were used to evaluate the relationship between observer counts and the actual number of bats emerging from the cave, as determined by analysis of the infra-red video footage of the flyout. The accuracy of flyout counts was found to decline with increasing flyout rates, with observers' counts becoming increasingly negatively biased as the rate of bat emergence from the mine increased. In addition, there was evidence of inter-observer variation in the accuracy of the counts. Although the bias in observer counts was relatively small, caution needs to be exercised in interpreting the results of visual flyout counts. We conclude that the use of infira-red video footage for determining numbers is preferable to visual observer counts. The major difficulty in using flyout counts for monitoring is the considerable night-to-night variation in numbers of bats emerging, which could be attributed to variation in the proportion of bats emerging to forage, or to the use of alternative roosting sites by individual bats on successive nights. Both observer error and short-term temporal variation in numbers of emerging bats have the potential to bias population estimates of bats, and need to be properly accounted for if flyout counts are to be used as a tool for population assessment and monitoring.},

abstract = {Longstanding concerns with the role and interpretation of p-values in statistical practice prompted the American Statistical Association (ASA) to make a statement on p-values. The ASA statement spurred a flurry of responses and discussions by statisticians, with many wondering about the steps necessary to expand the adoption of these principles. Introductory statistics classrooms are key locations to introduce and emphasize the nuance related to p-values; in part because they engrain appropriate analysis choices at the earliest stages of statistics education, and also because they reach the broadest group of students. We propose a framework for statistics departments to conduct a content audit for p-value principles in their introductory curriculum. We then discuss the process and results from applying this course audit framework within our own statistics department. We also recommend meeting with client departments as a complement to the course audit. Discussions about analyses and practices common to particular fields can help to evaluate if our service courses are meeting the needs of client departments and to identify what is needed in our introductory courses to combat the misunderstanding and future misuse of p-values.

abstract = {Populations of species with complex life cycles have the potential to be regulated at multiple life history stages. However, research tends to focus on single stage density-dependence, which can lead to inaccurate conclusions about population regulation and subsequently hinder conservation efforts. In amphibians, many studies have demonstrated strong effects of larval density and have often assumed that populations are regulated at this life history stage. However, studies examining density regulation in the terrestrial stages are rare, and the functional relationships between terrestrial density and vital rates in amphibians are unknown. We determined the effects of population density on survival, growth and reproductive development in the terrestrial stage of two amphibians by raising juvenile wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and American toads (Bufo americanus) at six densities in terrestrial enclosures. Density had strong negative effects on survival, growth and reproductive development in both species. We fitted a priori recruitment functions to describe the relationship between initial density and the density of survivors after one year, and determined the functional relationship between initial density and mass after one year. Animals raised at the lowest densities experienced growth and survival rates that were over twice as great as those raised at the highest density. All female wood frogs in the lowest density treatment showed signs of reproductive development, compared to only 6{\%} in the highest density treatment. Female American toads reached minimum reproductive size only at low densities, and male wood frogs and American toads reached maturity only in the three lowest density treatments. Our results demonstrate that in the complex life cycle of amphibians, density in the terrestrial stage can reduce growth, survival and reproductive development and may play an important role in amphibian population regulation. We discuss the implications of these results for population regulation in complex life cycles and for amphibian conservation.},

abstract = {While seasonal ponds in the scrub landscape of the Lake Wales Ridge in south-central Florida are favorable for establishment of small south Florida slash pines (Pinus elliottii var. densa), few seasonal ponds have mature trees. We hypothesize that disturbances (fire and/or flooding) periodically exclude trees from seasonal ponds. We studied the demography of slash pines in relation to water level and fire for a decade from 1992–2001 in four seasonal ponds, two with long and two with short hydroperiods. Seasonal ponds were favorable for pine growth (0.1–0.6 m increase in height annually, growth from grass-stage to one meter in about 7 y) and annual survival (survival generally over 80{\%} in years without fires). Most recruitment (appearance of seedlings in a “grass stage”) occurred in drier ponds. Flooding episodes occurred in most years and lasted 3–11 mo. Mortality increased with flooding intensity (summed flooding depth) in 3 of 9 y and was concentrated in pines {\textless}1 m tall. Growth rates were unaffected by flooding. A low-intensity prescribed fire created 72{\%} mortality, while a large intense wildfire caused nearly 100{\%} mortality. Although South Florida slash pine can survive short-term flooding and moderately intense fire, both flooding and fire can exclude trees from many seasonal ponds. Fire was a stronger force during our study. Seasonal ponds in south-central Florida are usually treeless not because conditions are generally unfavorable for growth and establishment of south Florida slash pines, but because episodic flooding and fire cause massive mortality of seedling and sapling pines},

abstract = {Forests and woodlands have long been associated with tourism and recreation and there is a growing demand for improved planning tools to measure and maximize amenity value from policy intervention. Building on earlier studies, this study develops a trip generation function (TGF) to predict visit rates to public and privately owned forest sites in Great Britain. Using a zonal approach, the models were based on visit counts to 100 countryside woodland sites. A survey of forest managers was made to collect data on facilities and characteristics, and geographical information systems analysis was used to define outset zones and compile data on the population living within the zones and the quality and accessibility of alternative woodlands. A series of stand-alone TGFs were developed. In addition to size of population living within a 2-h travel time and substitute-site accessibility, the results highlighted the importance of the number of site facilities in determining visit rates. The results of a cross-validation suggest that the TGFs are sufficiently robust to predict visitor numbers at an aggregate level. However, the current value of this type of modelling to forest management decision making, and further advancement in modelling to allow transferability of results to unsurveyed sites is currently constrained by a number of data limitations, including the quality of available visit data. {\textcopyright} Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2006.

abstract = {This article examines the evidence contained in t statistics that are marginally significant in 5{\%} tests. The bases for evaluating evidence are likelihood ratios and integrated likelihood ratios, computed under a variety of assumptions regarding the alternative hypotheses in null hypothesis significance tests. Likelihood ratios and integrated likelihood ratios provide a useful measure of the evidence in favor of competing hypotheses because they can be interpreted as representing the ratio of the probabilities that each hypothesis assigns to observed data. When they are either very large or very small, they suggest that one hypothesis is much better than the other in predicting observed data. If they are close to 1.0, then both hypotheses provide approximately equally valid explanations for observed data. I find that p-values that are close to 0.05 (i.e., that are "marginally significant") correspond to integrated likelihood ratios that are bounded by approximately 7 in two-sided tests, and by approximately 4 in one-sided tests. The modest magnitude of integrated likelihood ratios corresponding to p-values close to 0.05 clearly suggests that higher standards of evidence are needed to support claims of novel discoveries and new effects.

This report describes progress made toward producing a fully American chestnut tree with enhanced resistance to the blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica). The transgenic American chestnut 'Darling4,' produced through an Agrobacterium co-transformation procedure to express a wheat oxalate oxidase gene driven by the VspB vascular promoter, shows enhanced blight resistance at a level intermediate between susceptible American chestnut and resistant Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima). Enhanced resistance was identified first with a leaf-inoculation assay using young chestnuts grown indoors, and confirmed with traditional stem inoculations on 3- and 4-year-old field-grown trees. Pollen from 'Darling4' and other events was used to produce transgenic T1 seedlings, which also expressed the enhanced resistance trait in leaf assays. Outcrossed transgenic seedlings have several advantages over tissue-cultured plantlets, including increased genetic diversity and faster initial growth. This represents a major step toward the restoration of the majestic American chestnut.},

abstract = {Terrestrial support of aquatic food webs is becoming well established in the science of ecology. However, while terrestrial subsidies of energy have been shown to exert strong effects on aquatic food webs, it is less clear how variations in these subsidies, via natural or anthropogenic factors, will affect recipient ecosystems. To assess the influence of variations in terrestrial subsidies on an aquatic food web, we manipulated leaf-litter inputs in artificial ponds. Decreasing litter inputs did not affect any of the response variables in artificial ponds. This may be because the minimal amount of terrestrial carbon present combined with autochthonous production was enough to sustain the food web and/or the food web was altered in ways not detected by the experimental design. However, increasing leaf-litter inputs increased the percent survival and developmental rate of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). Conversely, increasing litter input appeared to have no influence on zooplankton or salamander larvae. Increasing litter inputs also increased the dissolved organic carbon content and decreased the percent saturation of dissolved oxygen in artificial ponds. As system respiration in aquatic systems is frequently dominated by microbial respiration, we hypothesize that the effects of increasing litter input on wood frogs were the result of an increase food resources (i.e., microbes) for tadpoles. The lack of a response by salamander larvae and zooplankton may be due to the densities of zooplankton in tanks providing enough food for salamanders in all treatments, variation among specific zooplankton species in their ability to exploit these resources and transfer energy to salamanders, or omnivory among zooplankton offsetting the affects of leaf-litter inputs. Additional work is needed to determine the influence of litter inputs on zooplankton and salamanders in this community. These data demonstrate that variations in leaf-litter inputs can influence food web structure; however, the importance of these variations will likely be dependent upon the trophic position of various consumers.},

abstract = {Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) differ from lowland moist forests in structure (low stature, small and tough leaves, low diversity) and functioning (low productivity, low nutrient-cycling rates). To explain these differences, a variety of hypotheses have been proposed, most of which are related directly or indirectly to climate, but none of these provides a satisfactory explanation for all typical TMCF traits. The single climatic factor shared by all TMCF, the frequent occurrence of low cloud, has multiple effects, but not all are well understood. In this paper we describe and analyze the climatic and soil-moisture conditions prevailing in TMCF as reported in the literature. TMCF evapotranspiration is limited by both climatic conditions and canopy conductance. TMCF productivity is low, but our understanding of these forest's carbon balance is incomplete. Leaf photosynthetic capacity is not particularly low, but canopy photosynthesis probably is, due to persistent cloudiness (low radiation) and a low leaf-area index (LAI). We suggest that the low LAI of TMCF is controlled by light climate and by leaf structure and longevity. TMCF productivity is probably further limited by a substantial investment of carbon in the growth and functioning of a relatively large root system, which is itself a consequence of unfavorable soil conditions.},

abstract = {Predicting how timber harvesting will influence sensitive taxa such as amphibians is of critical importance for sustainable management of forests. In 2004 and 2005, we studied the effects of four forestry treatments (clearcut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, clearcut with CWD retained, partial-cut of 50{\%} of canopy cover, and an uncut control) on movement, habitat selection, and abundance of amphibians in Maine. Four landscape-scale replicates of these four forestry treatments were created with each replicate centered on a breeding pool. A total of 8632 emerging juvenile wood frogs were captured and marked at drift fences encircling breeding pools, with 1166 marked wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), and 13,727 unmarked amphibians captured in drift fence/pitfall arrays at 16, 50, 100, and 150 m from the pools. Our capture results in the different treatments were consistent with previous studies in showing that adult abundance and habitat use differed among species, with wood frogs, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), and eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) preferring uncut and partial-cut habitat, and adult green frogs (Rana clamitans) and American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) being more tolerant of clearcutting. Spotted salamanders also showed reduced captures with partial canopy removal and increased captures with the retention of CWD. Our results for juvenile amphibians differed from previous research, with lower captures of all study species (statistically significant for seven of nine species) in clearcuts compared to uncut and partial-cut treatments. Clearcuts did not reduce habitat permeability for the low number of marked wood frogs that entered these treatments. Data from marked wood frogs also suggest that both density of conspecifics and habitat quality can influence habitat selection, and potentially dispersal of juvenile amphibians. The avoidance of clearcuts by juveniles of all study species suggests that this silvicultural technique may reduce both abundance and dispersal of many species, rather than just species where adults are known to be forest-dependent. Species may also be affected by partial as well as full canopy removal, and the retention of CWD may play a role in mitigating some of the effects of clearcutting. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

annote = {This study examined how Red-backed Salamanders respond to habitat conditions imposed by different forest management protocols in Vermont. VES were used to sample salamander abundances in sites that had different silvicultural treatments (single-tree selection, group-selection, and "structural complexity enhancement"). While the researchers didn't find any significant effect of treatment, they did find some effects of habitat conditions themselves on salamander abundances. They used AIC for model selection, using QAICc to account for model over-dispersion. Their highest ranking models revealed a positive relationship between CWD density and abundance. Contrary to previous studies, volume of CWD was not correlated with adundance. This may be explained by the territoriality of Red-backed Salamanders. A greater density of individual CWD objects may actually provide more habitat for this species, as individuals frequently compete over the same cover objects. The authors argue that structural complexity enhancement techniques may be beneficial to this species, as this method retains and promotes greater CWD densities in the short-term.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of landscape and wetland characteristics on pond-breeding amphibian assemblages in south-central New Hampshire, a relatively low populated and heavily forested region of the northeastern United States. This allowed us to better understand landscape influences in less disturbed areas, and to determine critical landscape disturbance thresholds, above which amphibians are negatively impacted. We sampled 61 wetlands for larval amphibians in 1998 and 1999 to examine the influence of forest cover and road density (at seven buffer distances between 100 and 2000 m) and wetland characteristics on larval amphibian assemblages. Assemblages were influenced primarily by forest cover and wetland hydroperiod. Species richness was most strongly influenced by the proportion of forest cover within 1000 m of the wetland. Several species were also influenced by forest cover, but were differentially influenced by buffer widths. Our study suggests that, at least in the northeast US, wetlands with {\textless}40{\%} forest cover within a 1000 m radius may have depauperate larval amphibian assemblages, and forest cover above 60{\%} within a 1000 m radius is likely to ensure species rich and abundant larval amphibian assemblages. Given the above, current federal and state regulations that focus amphibian protection efforts on narrow terrestrial buffers surrounding wetlands are likely to be inadequate. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. Understanding the trophic status of consumers in freshwater habitats is central to understanding their ecological roles and significance. Tadpoles are a diverse and abundant component of many freshwater habitats, yet we know relatively little about their feeding ecology and true trophic status compared with many other consumer groups. While many tadpole species are labelled herbivores or detritivores, there is surprisingly little evidence to support these trophic assignments. 2. Here we discuss shortcomings in our knowledge of the feeding ecology and trophic status of tadpoles and provide suggestions and examples of how we can more accurately quantify their trophic status and ecological significance. 3. Given the catastrophic amphibian declines that are ongoing in many regions of the planet, there is a sense of urgency regarding this information. Understanding the varied ecological roles of tadpoles will allow for more effective conservation of remaining populations, benefit captive breeding programmes, and allow for more accurate predic- tions of the ecological consequences of their losses.},

abstract = {Conservation efforts to protect forested landscapes are challenged by climate projections that suggest substantial restructuring of vegetation and disturbance regimes in the future. In this regard, paleoecological records that describe ecosystem responses to past variations in climate, fire, and human activity offer critical information for assessing present landscape conditions and future landscape vulnerability. We illustrate this point drawing on 8 sites in the northwestern United States, New Zealand, Patagonia, and central and southern Europe that have undergone different levels of climate and land-use change. These sites fall along a gradient of landscape conditions that range from nearly pristine (i.e., vegetation and disturbance shaped primarily by past climate and biophysical constraints) to highly altered (i.e., landscapes that have been intensely modified by past human activity). Position on this gradient has implications for understanding the role of natural and anthropogenic disturbance in shaping ecosystem dynamics and assessments of present biodiversity, including recognizing missing or overrepresented species. Dramatic vegetation reorganization occurred at all study sites as a result of postglacial climate variations. In nearly pristine landscapes, such as those in Yellowstone National Park, climate has remained the primary driver of ecosystem change up to the present day. In Europe, natural vegetation–climate–fire linkages were broken 6000–8000 years ago with the onset of Neolithic farming, and in New Zealand, natural linkages were first lost about 700 years ago with arrival of the Maori people. In the U.S. Northwest and Patagonia, the greatest landscape alteration occurred in the last 150 years with Euro-American settlement. Paleoecology is sometimes the best and only tool for evaluating the degree of landscape alteration and the extent to which landscapes retain natural components. Information on landscape-level history thus helps assess current ecological change, clarify management objectives, and define conservation strategies that seek to protect both natural and cultural elements.},

abstract = {We surveyed a streamside community in a southern Appalachian old-growth forest to determine the feasibility of using removal sampling to estimate salamander density and biomass. We removed salamanders during 21 nightly searches of two 30 × 30 m plots from 29 June to 20 July 1999. Despite the removal of 2433 animals and a lack of evidence for significant trespass onto plots, there was no overall decline in total catch per night. Moisture levels associated with recent rainfall history strongly influenced the surface activity of small species (Desmognathus carolinensis, Desmognathus wrighti, Eurycea bislineata wilderae) but not large species (Plethodon jordani, Plethodon glutinosus, Plethodon yonahlossee). More refined analyses of individual species using either regression analysis (large species) or covariance analysis (small species adjusted for moisture conditions) indicate that the catch of all species except D. wrighti declined with time. The estimated number of consecutive nights required to remove 70{\%} of the population varied from eight (P. yonahlossee) to 32 (D. carolinensis) and tended to be inversely related to the body size of the species. Conservative estimates of total salamander density and wet biomass in streamside habitats at this site are 18,486 individuals and 16.53 kg per hectare. These values are seven and 14 times greater than those reported for the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire and underscore the importance of salamanders in riparian zone communities of southern Appalachian forests.},

In this paper, we develop a novel optimality model that, given current incentives to publish, predicts a researcher's most rational use of resources in terms of the number of studies to undertake, the statistical power to devote to each study, and the desirable pre-study odds to pursue. We then develop a methodology that allows one to estimate the reliability of published research by considering a distribution of preferred research strategies. Using this approach, we investigate the merits of adopting measures of `greater statistical stringency' with the goal of informing the ongoing debate.},

Restoration of American chestnut by using biotechnology is promising, but the imprecise nature of transgenesis may inadvertently alter tree phenotype, thus potentially impacting ecologically dependent organisms. We quantified effects of genetic engineering and fungal inoculation of trees on insect herbivores by using transgenic American chestnuts expressing an oxalate oxidase gene and wild-type American and Chinese (C. mollissima Blume) chestnuts. Of three generalist folivores bioassayed, only gypsy moth [Lymantria dispar (L.)] was affected by genetic modification, exhibiting faster growth on transgenic than on wild-type chestnuts, whereas growth of polyphemus moth [Antheraea polyphemus (Cramer) ] differed between wild-type species, ...},

abstract = {Background
Significant shifts in climate are considered a threat to plants and animals with significant physiological limitations and limited dispersal abilities. The southern Appalachian Mountains are a global hotspot for plethodontid salamander diversity. Plethodontids are lungless ectotherms, so their ecology is strongly governed by temperature and precipitation. Many plethodontid species in southern Appalachia exist in high elevation habitats that may be at or near their thermal maxima, and may also have limited dispersal abilities across warmer valley bottoms.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We used a maximum-entropy approach (program Maxent) to model the suitable climatic habitat of 41 plethodontid salamander species inhabiting the Appalachian Highlands region (33 individual species and eight species included within two species complexes). We evaluated the relative change in suitable climatic habitat for these species in the Appalachian Highlands from the current climate to the years 2020, 2050, and 2080, using both the HADCM3 and the CGCM3 models, each under low and high CO2 scenarios, and using two-model thresholds levels (relative suitability thresholds for determining suitable/unsuitable range), for a total of 8 scenarios per species.

Conclusion/Significance
While models differed slightly, every scenario projected significant declines in suitable habitat within the Appalachian Highlands as early as 2020. Species with more southern ranges and with smaller ranges had larger projected habitat loss. Despite significant differences in projected precipitation changes to the region, projections did not differ significantly between global circulation models. CO2 emissions scenario and model threshold had small effects on projected habitat loss by 2020, but did not affect longer-term projections. Results of this study indicate that choice of model threshold and CO2 emissions scenario affect short-term projected shifts in climatic distributions of species; however, these factors and choice of global circulation model have relatively small affects on what is significant projected loss of habitat for many salamander species that currently occupy the Appalachian Highlands.},

abstract = {Summary: To assess recovery of endangered species, reliable information on the size and density of the target population is required. In practice, however, this information has proved hard to acquire, especially for large carnivores that exist at low densities, are cryptic and range widely. Many large carnivore species such as the endangered Florida panther Puma concolor coryi lack clear visual features for individual identification; thus, using standard approaches for estimating population size, such as camera-tra pping and capture-recapture modelling, has so far not been possible. We developed a spatial capture-recapture model that requires only a portion of the individuals in the population to be identifiable, using data from two 9-month camera-trapping surveys conducted within the core range of panthers in southwestern Florida. Identity of three radio-collared individuals was known, and we incorporated their telemetry location data into the model to improve parameter estimates. The resulting density estimates of 1{\textperiodcentered}51 (±0{\textperiodcentered}81) and 1{\textperiodcentered}46 (±0{\textperiodcentered}76) Florida panthers per 100 km 2  for each year are the first estimates for this endangered subspecies and are consistent with estimates for other puma subspecies. A simulation study showed that estimates of density may exhibit some positive bias but coverage of the true values by 95{\%} credible intervals was nominal. Synthesis and applications. This approach provides a framework for monitoring the Florida panther - and other species without conspicuous markings - while fully accounting for imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, issues of fundamental importance in the monitoring of wildlife populations.

abstract = {Because of the importance of salamanders in forest food chains, the effects of forest management practices on populations of these animals warrant consideration. We compared the numbers and activity patterns of salamanders in areas of a deciduous forest in central New York State that had been cut selectively for firewood, or clearcut, or planted with conifers. Numbers of salamanders were lower in three recently distrurbed habitats than in adjacent old-growth control stands. The frequency of above-ground activity by both species of salamanders was positively correlated with the density of understory vegetation and the depth of leaf litter. Small-scale habitat disruption associated with harvesting firewood increased the numbers of the terrestrial eft stage of the red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) but had no effect on numbers of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). A recently clearcut area had fewer red-backed salamanders than adjacent old-growth forest had, but the numbers of salamanders in a 60-year-old second-growth forest were indistinguishable from those in the adjacent old-growth forest. Populations of salamanders in a conifer plantation were low. Thus, salamanders seem to be resilient to limited disturbance of forests, but major changes are likely to affect populations of salamanders and, consequently, of birds and mammals that depend on salamanders for food. ?? 1987.},

Abundances were most similar between the secondary forest and the old-growth forest, suggesting that 60 years of succession is sufficient to create adequate habitat conditions for the two species in this study. Above ground activity was lowest in recently clearcut stands, compared to old-growth stands. This study only looked at above ground activity, which is one limitation on the findings.

In nonparametric problems, they talk about convergence to the true function (density, regression, etc.) or the probability that the true function lies in a given set. But the usual paradigms' focus on learning the true model and parameters can distract the analyst from another important task: discovering whether there are many sets of models and parameters that describe the data reasonably well. When we discover many good models we can see in what ways they agree. Points of agreement give us more confidence in our inferences, but points of disagreement give us less.

Various forms of global change impose compelling needs for timely and reliable information on the status of wetlands worldwide, but several characteristics of wetlands make them challenging to monitor remotely: they lack a single, unifying  land-cover feature; they tend to be highly dynamic and their energy signatures are constantly changing; and steep environmental gradients in and around wetlands produce narrow ecotones that often are below the resolving capacity of remote sensors. These challenges and needs set the context for a special issue focused on wetland remote sensing. Contributed papers responded to one of three overarching questions aimed at improving remote, large-area monitoring of wetlands: (1) What approaches and data products are being developed specifically to support regional to global long-term monitoring of wetland landscapes? (2) What are the promising new technologies and sensor/multisensor approaches for more accurate and consistent detection of wetlands? (3) Are there studies that demonstrate how remote long-term monitoring of wetland landscapes can reveal changes that correspond with changes in land cover and land use and/or changes in climate?},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

Unmanaged zero-order basins were hotspots for amphibian diversity, with significant differences across geomorphic gradients. Captures of riparian-associated amphibians were higher in valley areas, usually within 2 m of basin center. Upland-associated amphibians were captured two times farther from basin centers than riparian-associated species, but highest densities occurred only 2–5 m from basin center. The most useful empirical models related captures of individual amphibian species to geomorphic, disturbance, moisture, and overstory variables. Ordination and indicator species analysis characterized geomorphic and other environmental gradients in am-phibian assemblages and suggested spatial compression of fluvial habitats and riparian-associated species in zero-order basins, in comparison with downstream areas. Our findings have implications for headwater areas managed to hedge risk to and uncertainty in amphibian persistence, namely in the delineation of zones with species management priority, and in the maintenance of natural fluvial and hillslope disturbance regimes, along with the microhabitat features cre-ated by these regimes.},

We compiled morph frequencies for 50,960 individual salamanders from 558 sites as recorded in the published literature and in unpublished field notes of herpetologists between 1908 and 2004. We observed that striping probability increased with increasing latitude, longitude, and elevation and decreased (from 80{\%} to 74{\%} range wide) with time. The combined forces of regional climate warming and, particularly, forest disturbance have evidently been sufficient to cause morphological evolution in this amphibian over the last century.},

abstract = {In the last decade there has been increasing evidence of amphibian declines from relatively pristine areas. Some declines are hypothesized to be the result of egg mortality caused by factors such as elevated solar UV-B irradiation, chemical pollutants, pathogenic fungi, and climate change. However, the population-level consequences of egg mortality have not been examined explicitly, and may be complicated by density dependence in intervening life-history stages. Here we develop a demographic model for two amphibians with contrasting life-history strategies, Bufo boreas and Ambystoma macrodactylum. We then use the complementary approaches of elasticity and limitation to examine the relationships among stage-specific survival rates, larval-stage density dependence and amphibian population dynamics. Elasticity analyses showed that for a range of density dependence scenarios both species were more sensitive to changes in post-embryonic survival parameters, particularly juvenile survival, than to egg survival, suggesting that mortality of later stages may play an important role in driving declines. Limitation analyses revealed that larval density dependence can dramatically alter the consequences of early mortality, reducing or even reversing the expected population-level effects of egg mortality. Thus, greater focus on later life stages and density dependence is called for to accurately assess how stressors are likely to affect amphibian populations of conservation concern.},

This increasing frequency of extreme El Nin{\~{o}} events continues for up to a century after GMT has stabilized, underpinned by an oceanic thermocline deepening that sustains faster warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific than the o-equatorial region.

We found 38 egg clutches and visited them on a fixed scheme by checking all nests at night for 6 d, yielding 1368 visits of 10 min each. Egg attendance frequency was highly uneven among nests and was positively correlated with clutch size. On average, 6.8{\%} ± 4.4{\%} of eggs in an egg clutch died each day. Daily egg mortality was inversely correlated with the attendance frequency, suggesting that paternal care is important to egg survival even though this is a low nest-attendance species. Variances of egg mortality were low when paternal care effort was high, but opposite results were found when paternal care effort was low, suggesting the fate of eggs can also be affected by factors other than paternal care, such as stump conditions. Our results suggest that parental care effort varies via a cost-benefit relationship of investment in the present offspring vs. future reproductive chances. Male frogs spent more time attending eggs when the clutch sizes were large but sought additional mating opportunities if the egg clutches were small, which resulted in large variations in egg mortality among clutches.},

Forest restoration practitioners are generally foresters or ecologists and their focus tends to be limited to the specific restoration interventions themselves, such as removing exotic species, protecting sites for natural regeneration and re-planting indigenous trees. Indeed there are many technical challenges, unknowns in technical aspects of forest landscape restoration and knowledge gaps. However, and even more so when dealing with large scales, additional challenges that fall under the governance umbrella such as tenure, policy measures and institutions have a significant impact on restoration, influencing it either positively or negatively. Conversely, the landscape-scale restoration work itself can influence and shape governance arrangements. This paper attempts to explore this wider relationship between large scale forest restoration − and specifically forest landscape restoration (FLR) − and governance. It is intended to assist and provide guidance to forest landscape restoration practitioners, researchers and policymakers on the consideration and importance of governance, and alternative ways in which the two-way relationship (between governance and FLR) plays out. A framework is proposed to support practitioners, researchers and decision-makers to address governance in forest landscape restoration.},

         {\textless}p{\textgreater}Biotechnology offers a new approach for the restoration of tree species affected by
            exotic pathogens; however, non‐target impacts of this novel strategy on other organisms
            have not been comprehensively assessed. We evaluated the effect of transgenic American
            chestnut ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Castanea dentata{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) leaf litter on the growth and survival of larval wood frogs ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Lithobates sylvaticus{\textless}/i{\textgreater}), a forest‐dwelling amphibian species widely sympatric with American chestnut, that
            forage almost entirely on periphyton and litter detritus that accumulate in temporary
            vernal pools in forests. We reared wood frog larvae on {\textless}i{\textgreater}Castanea{\textless}/i{\textgreater} leaf litter (American chestnut genetically engineered for blight tolerance, non‐transgenic
            American chestnut, Chinese chestnut [{\textless}i{\textgreater}C. mollissima{\textless}/i{\textgreater}], and a Chinese‐American Chestnut hybrid) and litter from two non‐{\textless}i{\textgreater}Castanea,{\textless}/i{\textgreater} non‐transgenic “control” tree species, coupled with two levels of supplementary food.
            We observed no differences in growth or survival of wood frog larvae reared on transgenic
            versus non‐transgenic American chestnut leaves. Without supplementary food, wood frog
            larvae provided leaves from American chestnut (both types) developed faster and grew
            larger than those exposed to other leaf litter treatments. Results of this study provide
            preliminary evidence that 1) American chestnut may have formerly been an important
            source of food for forest‐dwelling amphibians and 2) transgenic American chestnut
            litter generated as part of chestnut restoration efforts is unlikely to present direct
            novel risks to developing amphibian larvae in the forest environment.

abstract = {Shrinkage in body length, followed by growth, has rarely been documented in vertebrates and has been associated with stressful energetic and environmental conditions. Here, we document reversible shrinkage in an amphibian for the first time. Jollyville Plateau salamanders Eurycea tonkawae are neotenic (attain maturity while retaining an aquatic larval form) and inhabit springs and caves of a dissected aquifer in Travis County, TX, USA. We conducted mark-recapture surveys on a spring-dwelling population before and after an exceptional drought in 2008. Use of unique marks and digital photographs of individuals provided precise information on salamander growth rates during and after a period in which salamanders retreated to underground refugia to avoid desiccation during the drought. Tail width decreased significantly during the drought indicating a reduction in energy stores, a consequence of stressful environmental conditions. Unexpectedly, body length shrinkage also occurred during the drought and was followed by positive growth when spring flow resumed. Body length shrinkage could be an adaptation to coping with long periods of low food availability although its long-term effects are unknown. Given the influence of body size on many ecological and physiological characteristics of organisms, plasticity in body size may have important consequences that go undetected by researchers if shrinkage is ignored.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.Migrations of animals can transfer energy and nutrients through and among terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Pool-breeding amphibians, such as the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), make annual breeding migrations to ephemeral wetlands in forest habitats in the eastern and midwestern United States and Canada. To model the influence of wood frogs on nutrient transport and transformation through time, we coupled long-term population monitoring data (1985-2005) from a wood frog population with estimates of the elemental composition of wood frog egg masses and emerging juveniles. Over the 21-year study period, 8.8 kg carbon (C), 2.0 kg nitrogen (N) and 0.20 kg phosphorus (P) were transported from the terrestrial to the aquatic habitat and approximately 21 kg C, 5.5 kg N and 1.2 kg P were exported to the surrounding terrestrial habitat by wood frogs. During the study period, the average net flux of C, N and P was from aquatic to terrestrial habitats, but the magnitude and direction of the net flux was element dependent. Thus, the net flux of C, N and P did not always flow in the same direction. Predicting long-term trends in nutrient and energy flux by organisms with biphasic life cycles should rely on long-term population data to account for temporal variability. This is especially true for organisms that are sensitive to long-term shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns, such as amphibians that breed in ephemeral pools.},

abstract = {Many studies on birds focus on the collection of data through an experimental design, suitable for investigation in a classical analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework. Although many findings are confirmed by one or more experts, expert information is rarely used in conjunction with the survey data to enhance the explanatory and predictive power of the model. We explore this neglected aspect of ecological modelling through a study on Australian woodland birds, focusing on the potential impact of different intensities of commercial cattle grazing on bird density in woodland habitat. We examine a number of Bayesian hierarchical random effects models, which cater for overdispersion and a high frequency of zeros in the data using WinBUGS and explore the variation between and within different grazing regimes and species. The impact and value of expert information is investigated through the inclusion of priors that reflect the experience of 20 experts in the field of bird responses to disturbance. Results indicate that expert information moderates the survey data, especially in situations where there are little or no data. When experts agreed, credible intervals for predictions were tightened considerably. When experts failed to agree, results were similar to those evaluated in the absence of expert information. Overall, we found that without expert opinion our knowledge was quite weak. The fact that the survey data is quite consistent, in general, with expert opinion shows that we do know something about birds and grazing and we could learn a lot faster if we used this approach more in ecology, where data are scarce.

abstract = {Abstract In this chapter, we cover a number of important extensions of the basic hierarchical distance-sampling (HDS) framework from Chapter 8. First, we discuss the inclusion of “individual covariates,” such as group size, in the HDS model. This is important in many surveys where animals form natural groups that are the primary observation unit, with the size of the group expected to have some influence on detectability. We also discuss HDS integrated with time-removal and double-observer or capture-recapture sampling. These “combined protocols” can be formulated as HDS models with individual covariates, and thus they have a commonality with HDS models involving group structure (group size being just another individual covariate). We cover several varieties of open-population HDS models that accommodate population dynamics. On one end of the spectrum, we cover models that allow replicate distance sampling surveys within a year, which estimate abundance relative to availability and temporary emigration through time. We consider a robust design version of that model. We then consider models with explicit dynamics based on the Dail and Madsen (2011) model and the work of Sollmann et al. (2015). The final major theme of this chapter is relatively newly developed spatial distance sampling models that accommodate explicit models describing the spatial distribution of individuals known as Point Process models. We provide novel formulations of spatial DS and HDS models in this chapter, including implementations of those models in the unmarked package using a hack of the pcount function for N-mixture models.},

abstract = {Amphibians are frequently characterized as having limited dispersal abilities, strong site fidelity and spatially disjunct breeding habitat. As such, pond-breeding species are often alleged to form metapopulations. Amphibian species worldwide appear to be suffering population level declines caused, at least in part, by the degradation and fragmentation of habitat and the intervening areas between habitat patches. If the simplification of amphibians occupying metapopulations is accurate, then a regionally based conservation strategy, informed by metapopulation theory, is a powerful tool to estimate the isolation and extinction of ponds or populations. risk However, to date no attempt to assess the class-wide generalization of amphibian populations as metapopulations has been made. We reviewed the literature on amphibians as metapopulations (53 journal articles or theses) and amphibian dispersal (166 journal articles or theses for 53 anuran species and 37 salamander species) to evaluate whether the conditions for metapopulation structure had been tested, whether pond isolation was based only on the assumption of limited dispersal, and whether amphibian dispersal was uniformly limited. We found that in the majority of cases (74{\%}) the assumptions of the metapopulation paradigm were not tested. Breeding patch isolation via limited dispersal and/or strong site fidelity was the most frequently implicated or tested metapopulation condition, however we found strong evidence that amphibian dispersal is not as uniformly limited as is often thought. The frequency distribution of maximum movements for anurans and salamanders was well described by an inverse power law. This relationship predicts that distances beneath 11-13 and 8-9 km, respectively, are in a range that they may receive one emigrating individual. Populations isolated by distances approaching this range are perhaps more likely to exhibit metapopulation structure than less isolated populations. Those studies that covered larger areas also tended to report longer maximum movement distances - a pattern with implications the design for of mark-recapture studies. Caution should be exercised in the application of the metapopulation approach to amphibian population conserv- ation. Some amphibian populations are structured as metapopulations - but not all},
annote = {The general conclusion from this paper is that the term "metapopulation" is being overused in amphibian literature. This review looked at 53 peer-reviewed articles about amphibians that used "metapopulation" in the title, abstract, or keywords, and assessed which, if any, of Hanski's four metapopulation conditions (Hanski, 1999) were tested versus assumed in each publication. 

Metapopulation conditions:
(1) habitat patches support local breeding pops
(2) individual pops are too small to ensure long-term survival (pops are not rooted)
(3) patches are close enough to allow intermovement (limited dispersal)
(4) patches are sufficiently asynchronous to make simultaneous extinction of all pops unlikely

Most frequently metapopulation condition assessed is (3) limited dispersal. Though this condition is usually estimated indirectly. 

Almost one half of frog species studied are capable of dispersing distances greater than 1km (usually seen as a threshold for isolation/limited dispersal effects) and 7{\%} can disperse greater than 10km.

Average maximum movement of anurans from natal ponds is 2.02km},

abstract = {Th e input of leaf litter resources is a major driver of ecosystem processes in terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Although variation exists in the quantity and composition of litter inputs due to natural and anthropogenic causes, few studies have examined how such variation infl uences the structure and composition of aquatic food webs. Using outdoor mesocosms, we examined the bottom – up eff ects of 10 chemically distinct tree litter species on microbial, algal, invertebrate and vertebrate fauna found in temperate ponds. We hypothesized that individual litter species, which diff er in their traits, would diff erentially and predictably aff ect abiotic and biotic elements of pond communities. We further hypothesized that the presence of leaf litter, regardless of species, would elevate resource supply and increase the biomass of community members. Finally, we hypothesized that a mixture of litter species would have non-additive eff ects on community responses. We followed the system for ? 4 months and measured ? 30 abiotic and biotic responses related to primary and secondary production. Th e diff erent species of leaf litter had major eff ects on abiotic and biotic responses, including phytoplank- ton, periphyton, zooplankton, snails, amphipods and tadpoles. Most biological responses were negatively associated with soluble carbon content of litter, or litter decay rate. Other litter traits, including phenolic concentrations and litter C:N were of secondary importance but did exhibit both positive and negative associations with several responses. Th e absence of litter had pervasive eff ects on abiotic attributes, but did not promote substantial changes in organism biomass. Most responses to the litter mixture were additive. Our results suggest that changes in temperate forest composition can strongly affect pond communities.},

Producing trees that are resistant to such threats is frequently emphasized by policymakers across Europe and North America. However, there are several approaches for developing and deploying resistant trees, and the process can be time-consuming and potentially complex and controversial. Here, we provide a frame-work to inform the selection of the most suitable approaches in different contexts, highlighting important con-straints and considerations associated with using resistant trees. We identify six common steps within resistant tree programmes, and for each step discuss a range of options. Our proposed framework emphasizes inter-dependencies amongst these steps, and can inform decisions and approaches in proposed and ongoing resist-ance programmes. We also highlight potential pitfalls in the use of resistant trees, including: low durability of resistance, low viability against other threats, lack of acceptability/demand from forest owners and the public, and negative ecological impacts. Lastly, we emphasize the need to evaluate resistant trees alongside complementary strategies for mitigating the impacts of pests and pathogens (e.g. biosecurity, maintenance of adaptive capacity), and in the context of the other anthropogenic pressures faced by trees and forests.},

Survival experiments consist of at least one treatment and one control group, animals being marked to reflect group membership, with the purpose of comparing survival across treatment levels. An introduction to some basic statistical principles is included; this introduction is followed by development of theory specific to the type of data considered. Five experimental protocols are defined and maximum likelihood estimates of parameters are derived for each model in the sequence under each experimental protocol. An intensive battery of statistical tests of hypotheses are given to allow assessment of the validity of assumptions and to aid in model selection. Material presented in several parts of the monograph is cast in terms of fish survival experiments in relation to hydroelectric dams. Although such experiments provide a convenient example, the theory and methods presented have potential application to many other taxonomic groups and experimental situations. The methodology presented provides a rigorous, comprehensive, and practical reference on the analysis of experiments involving recapture of marked animals. The emphasis is on general inference procedures: point and interval estimates and tests of hypotheses. Comprehensive computer software (RELEASE) is provided to allow a full analysis of experimental data collected under these protocols. An interactive version of RELEASE is easy to use on currently-available microcomputers. The material is written for both biologists and statisticians in an effort to integrate theory and application. A solid foundation is provided for making inference from survival experiments using marked animals. The interaction between theory and practice under careful scrutiny of good biologists and statisticians (or other critical disciplines) will provide direction for further theory development.},

A testing procedure is developed using a mixture of frequentist and Bayesian tools, with a significance level that is a function of sample size, obtained from a generalized form of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma that minimizes a linear combination of $\alpha$, the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis, and $\beta$, the probability of failing to reject a false null, instead of fixing $\alpha$ and minimizing $\beta$. The resulting hypothesis tests do not violate the Likelihood Principle and do not require any constraints on the dimensionalities of the sample space and parameter space. The procedure includes an ordering of the entire sample space and uses predictive probability (density) functions, allowing for testing of both simple and compound hypotheses. Accessible examples are presented to highlight specific characteristics of the new tests. ARTICLE HISTORY},

abstract = {Since the late 1980s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has helped restore hundreds of wetlands in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, in an effort to enhance the production of waterfowl and other wetland associated species. During summer 2004, we re-examined I I restorations to determine how their plant communities had changed since 1992. In addition, we re-evaluated waterfowl and anuran communities at eight restorations. Because 1992 data were compiled from separate studies, all three groups of organisms were simultaneously examined at only two wetlands. Significant decreases in plant diversity and plant species richness were detected between 1992 and 2004, while significant increases were detected for species classified as obligate or facultative wet. These changes suggest that the plant communities at the restorations have matured since 1992. Use of the wetlands by waterfowl and anurans, on the other hand, did not exhibit significant change over this period. Regular monitoring of restorations over even longer periods will provide new insights into the way in which restored communities develop and whether current restoration methods have succeeded in establishing stable, species-rich wetland communities.},

abstract = {Such is the grip of formal methods of statistical inference-that is, frequentist methods for generalizing from sample to population in enumerative studies-in the drawing of scientific inferences that the two are routinely deemed equivalent in the social, management, and biomedical sciences. This, despite the fact that legitimate employment of said methods is difficult to implement on practical grounds alone. But supposing the adoption of these procedures were simple does not get us far; crucially, methods of formal statistical inference are ill-suited to the analysis of much scientific data. Even findings from the claimed gold standard for examination by the latter, randomized controlled trials, can be problematic. Scientific inference is a far broader concept than statistical inference. Its authority derives from the accumulation , over an extensive period of time, of both theoretical and empirical knowledge that has won the (provisional) acceptance of the scholarly community. A major focus of scientific inference can be viewed as the pursuit of significant sameness, meaning replicable and empirically generalizable results among phenomena. Regrettably, the obsession with users of statistical inference to report significant differences in data sets actively thwarts cumulative knowledge development. The manifold problems surrounding the implementation and usefulness of formal methods of statistical inference in advancing science do not speak well of much teaching in methods/statistics classes. Serious reflection on statistics' role in producing viable knowledge is needed. Commendably, the American Statistical Association is committed to addressing this challenge, as further witnessed in this special online, open access issue of The American Statistician.},

abstract = {In forested ecosystems timber harvesting has the potential to emulate natural disturbances, thereby maintaining the natural communities adapted to particular disturbances. We compared the effects of even-aged (clearcut and patch cut) and uneven-aged (group cut, single-tree selection) timber management techniques with natural ice-storm damage and unmanipulated reference forest sites on red-backed salamanders. We used cover boards and litter searches to survey for salamanders in northern hardwood forests in New Hampshire, USA. We estimated abundance while accounting for detection probability using the Dail-Madsen open population model. We found significant reduction in salamander abundance in recent group cuts, patch cuts, and clearcuts compared to reference forest sites, and significant but less effect of single-tree selection and ice-storm damage. Our results contribute to the evidence of detrimental effects of even-aged harvests on salamander abundance, but in contrast to most previous research, we also found lower abundance in sites following uneven-aged harvest practices when we accounted for detection probability. To more accurately reflect the total effect of harvests on salamanders, we also employed a parametric, nonlinear hierarchical model to estimate edge effects while accounting for imperfect detection. We found that group cut, patch cut, and clearcut logging reduced salamander abundance 34. m into the surrounding forest. These edge effects can greatly expand the total area affected by logging, especially in the northeastern US where cuts tend to be relatively small. This novel method for estimating edge effects will allow managers to directly calculate the total effects on populations for various size and shape harvesting plans. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Agricultural land abandonment has been increasing worldwide for environmental and socio-economic reasons, and knowledge of its key ecological processes (e.g., carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) input and accumulation) in relation to vegetation succession can provide important information for ecosystem management and greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. In order to better understand the above- and belowground litter dynamics following agricultural abandonment, we simultaneously studied the litter and fine root production, quality, decomposition, C and N input in ecosystems along a secondary successional gradient (i.e., grassland, shrub-grass land, young secondary forest, and mature secondary forest) following agricultural abandonment in China's Qinling Mountains. Results showed that the significant increase of aboveground woody plant litter and decrease of grass litter during vegetation succession led little changes in total litter production and annual total C and N input in different succession stages, while the fine root production, fine root biomass, C input from fine root production increased significantly with stand age. The initial litter C concentration and fine root carbon: phosphorous ratio (C:P) were the main factors in explaining the variations of decomposition rates of litter and fine root, respectively. The increasing C concentration in litter and the increasing C:P ratio in fine root during vegetation succession had potentially driven the decreases in litter and fine root decomposition rate respectively. The accumulation of litter standing crop during vegetation succession could be attributed to the decreases in litter decomposition rate partly caused by changes in litter quality, rather than the increases in litter production. Our results imply that the changes in vegetation type have a much smaller role in the annual total litter production and the total litter C and N input than previously assumed, while the changes in quality and decomposition rate may have largely influenced C accumulation in stand floor and soil during secondary succession following agricultural abandonment. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Green space and parks in urban environments provide a range of ecosystem services and public benefits. However, planners and park managers can lack tools and resources to gather local information on how parks are used and what makes them desirable places for recreation and a wide variety of uses. Traditional survey methods to monitor park use and user preferences can be costly, time consuming, and challenging to apply at scale. Here, we overcome this limitation by using geotagged social media data to assess patterns of visitation to urban and peri-urban green space across park systems in the metropolitan area of the Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA. We find that parks with nearby water features, more amenities, greater accessibility from the presence of trails, and that are located within neighborhoods with higher population density, are associated with higher rates of visitation. As cities grow and shifts in demographics occur, more responsive management of public green space will become increasingly important to ensure urban parks provide ecosystem services and meet users' needs. Using social media data to rapidly assess park use at a lower cost than traditional surveys has the potential to inform public green space management with targeted information on user behavior and values of urban residents.},

abstract = {This study treats dead trees and their remnants in the managed and virgin forest of Rajhenavski Rog, Slovenia, at a location of Omphalodo-Fagetum omphalodetosum plant community. The study plots were selected in four forest cycle developmental phases (optimal, mixed, regeneration and juvenile phase) of both managed and virgin forest. The quantity (volume and dry matter) and the structure of coarse woody debris (CWD) were compared between the selected plots within the particular type of the forest, and between the virgin and the managed forest. Belowground CWD was quantified by modeling the tree's biomass and decaying processes of the trees. The results show significant differences in CWD between the virgin forest developmental phases. The highest concentration of CWD in the virgin forest was found in the regeneration phase (626.0 m3/ha and 179.3 tdry matter/ha), while the juvenile phase (248.3 m3/ha and 40.2 tdry matter/ha) has the smallest amount of CWD. Managed forest has very evenly distribution of CWD between developmental phases and it ranges from 41.0 m3/ha and 49.0 tdry matter/ha in the mixed developmental phase to 67.0 m3/ha and 56.2 tdry matter/ha in the juvenile phase. The main reasons for such a large differences are forest management measures (e.g. wood extraction, short rotation time, reduction of natural tree mortality), which decrease quantity, distribution and size of CWD. It was identified that forest management causes reduction and homogenization of CWD on our study plots, which can trigger degradation processes (e.g. soil erosion, reduction of site productivity, reduction of habitats). Tree heights curves show significant differences in maximum tree's height between the virgin and the managed forest. Maximum tree's height is lower in the managed forest which may indicate the reduction of forest productivity due to reduction of CWD. Study has shown some positive effects of forest management on accumulation of underground CWD in the managed forest (from 40.0 tdry matter/ha to 48.2 tdry matter/ha), which significantly exceeds underground CWD in the virgin forest (from 2.0 tdry matter/ha to 22.8 tdry matter/ha). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Pond-breeding amphibians require aquatic and terrestrial habitats to complete their lifecycles, and preservation of both habitats is necessary for maintaining local populations. Current wetland regulations focus primarily on aquatic habitats, and criteria to define critical upland habitats and regulations to protect them are often ambiguous or lacking. We examined the association between the presence of seven pond-breeding amphibian species and the landscape composition surrounding 54 wetlands located within the Till Plains and the Glaciated Plateau ecoregions of Ohio, USA. We quantified landscape composition within 200 m of the wetland ("core terrestrial zone") and the area extending from 200 m to 1 km from the wetland ("broader landscape context zone"). We constructed binary logistic regression models for each species, and evaluated them using Akaike Information Criterion. Presence of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), Jefferson's salamander complex (A. jeffersonianum) and smallmouth salamanders (A. texanum) was positively associated with the amount of forest within the core zone. Presence of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) was positively associated with the amount of forest within the core zone and the amount of forest within the broader landscape context zone. Presence of tiger salamanders (A. tigrinum tigrinum) was negatively associated with the cumulative length of paved roads within 1 km of the site, and presence of red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus v. viridescens) was negatively associated with the average linear distance to the five nearest wetlands. Overall salamander diversity was positively associated with the amount of forest within the core zone, and negatively associated with the presence of predatory fish and cumulative length of paved roads within 1 km of the site. Our results confirm the strong association between the structure of surrounding upland areas and amphibian diversity at breeding ponds, and stress the importance of preserving core terrestrial habitat around wetlands for maintaining amphibian diversity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

annote = {This study addressed the concept of "core habitat thresholds" for amphibians in the midwestern United States. The authors measured associations between amphibian breeding populations and surrounding habitats via repeated sampling of 54 wetlands over a period of four years. They selected a priori models by comparing candidate models with QAICc. Forest cover within 200m of wetlands was a major factor related to presence of most species - especially ambystomatids and the wood frog. Some species had specific responses to landscape components. Red-spotted newts were closely related to distance to nearest wetland (negative association). Tiger salamanders had a strong negative association with roads. Wood frogs displayed the most expansive response to surrounding forest cover - with abundance associated with both the amount of cover within 200 m and 1 km. Wood frogs are capable of making large dispersal distances and are affected by surrounding habitats at particularly large scales. This study is a valuable addition to the rich literature on habitat requirements of biphasic amphibians in North America. One potential issue with their findings is that all associations were made purely from wetland-level observations. Egg and larval activity may not correspond perfectly with actual population stability in the greater landscape context. Measuring egg and larval counts as a proxy for upland habitat suitability is efficient but only one half of the story.

Core terrestrial zone - 200 m from wetland
Broader landscape context zone - 200m - 1km from wetland

Salamander diversity positively associated with forest cover in core zone (and negatively associated with predatory fish presence and paved road length in broader landscape context zone)

Red-spotted newts more sparse in areas of lower wetland density
- spend a long time in a terrestrial red-eft stage (up to seven years), can be detrimented by poor terrestrial habitat
- absent in several high quality terrestrial sites in this study - populations might be regulated by wetland density

Wood frogs postiviely associated with forest cover at local and landscape scales
- they can also migrate huge distances (1.2 km, Berven {\&} Grudzen, 1990) and may not be as affected by wetland density

Climate change, land use, and transport vectors interact in complex ways to determine the spread of native and non-native invasive species, pathogens, and their effects on ecosystem dynamics. Early detection and in-depth understanding of invasive species and infectious diseases will require an integrated network of research platforms and information exchange to identify hotspots of invasion or disease emergence. Partnerships with state and federal agencies that monitor the spread and impacts of invasive species and pathogens will be critical in developing a national data and research network that can facilitate a full understanding of the resulting effects on ecosystems and society. Citizen science can also play a role; individuals can report new invasions, record phenological changes associated with invasions or disease outbreaks, and can participate in efforts such as the Breeding Bird Survey, which may reveal long-term biotic change following species invasions and disease spread. The ecological and societal impacts of invasive species and pathogens differ across gradients of climate and land use, and in the presence of global climate change may exacerbate both their propagation and impacts.

Our meta-analysis encompassing 221 study landscapes worldwide reveals forest restoration enhances biodiversity by 15–84{\%} and vegetation structure by 36–77{\%}, compared with degraded ecosystems. For the first time, we identify the main ecological drivers of forest restoration success (defined as a return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) at both the local and landscape scale. These are as follows: the time elapsed since restoration began, disturbance type and landscape context. The time elapsed since restoration began strongly drives restoration success in secondary forests, but not in selectively logged forests (which are more ecologically similar to reference systems). Landscape restoration will be most successful when previous disturbance is less intensive and habitat is less fragmented in the landscape. Restoration does not result in full recovery of biodiversity and vegetation structure, but can complement old-growth forests if there is sufficient time for ecological succession.},

abstract = {Context Landscape modification is an important driver of biodiversity declines, yet we lack insight into how ongoing landscape change and legacies of historical land use together shape biodiversity. Objectives We examined how a history of agricultural land use and current forest fragmentation influence the abundance of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). We hypothesized that historical agriculture and fragmentation cause changes in habitat quality and landscape structure that limit abundance. Methods We measured salamander abundance at 95 forested sites in New York, USA, and we determined whether sites were agricultural fields within the last five decades. We used a structural equation model to estimate relationships between historical agriculture and salamander abundance mediated by changes in forest vegetation, microclimate, and landscape structure. Results Historical agriculture affected salamander abundance by altering forest vegetation at a local scale and forest cover at a landscape scale. Abundance was lowest at post-agricultural sites with low woody vegetation, leaf litter depth, and canopy cover. Post-agricultural sites had limited forest cover in the surrounding landscape historically, and salamander abundance was positively related to historical forest cover, suggesting that connectivity to source populations affects colonization of regenerating forests. Abundance was also negatively related to current forest fragmentation. Conclusions Historical land use can have legacy effects on animal abundance on par with effects of ongoing landscape change. We showed that associations between animal abundance and historical land use can be driven by altered site conditions and surrounding habitat area, indicating that restoration efforts should consider local site conditions and landscape context.},

abstract = {Loss of native herbivores and introduction of livestock in many arid and semi-arid ecosystems around the world has shifted the competitive balance from herbaceous to woody plants, leading to biodiversity loss, reduced plant productivity, and soil erosion. To restore functions of these ecosystems, ecological replacements have been proposed as substitutes for extinct native herbivores. Here we predict how an ecological replacement giant tortoise population (Chelonoidis spp.) would interact with woody plants on Pinta Island in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Archipelago, where a small group of replacement tortoises was introduced in 2010 to initiate restoration of the island's plant community. We developed an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model that incorporated field-derived tortoise behavior and tortoise-plant interaction data to test whether tortoise introductions could lead to broad-scale changes in the plant community and, if so, at what tortoise densities. Tortoises reduced vegetation density in most (81{\%}) 50-year-long simulations if the tortoise density was at least 0.7 per hectare, a value well below typical densities. In a smaller proportion of simulations (30{\%}), tortoises increased local vegetation patchiness. Our results suggest that even moderate-density tortoise populations can reverse woody plant encroachment. Deployment of ecological replacement giant tortoises may therefore be a viable approach for restoring other arid and semi-arid ecosystems where a native herbivore that previously had strong interactions with the plant community has gone extinct. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.},

abstract = {The temperate deciduous forest of the northeastern United States is believed to be undergoing a shift from domination by mixed oak (Quercus sp.) to red maple (Acer rubrum); a shift termed "The Red Maple Paradox." This shift in the composition of the forest has the potential to affect ecosystems within the forest that use leaf litter as an energy source. To assess the impact of the red maple paradox on detrital food webs, we conducted a mesocosm experiment investigating the influence of red maple litter on the food web of temporary woodland ponds. Amphibian biomass and survival were significantly lower in experimental ponds that contained only maple litter. The negative effects of maple litter were most pronounced in larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). We hypothesize that this effect resulted from a temporary shift from a grazing-based food web in oak mesocosms to a microbial-based food web in maple mesocosms, as oak mesocosms initially had higher levels of phytoplankton biomass and lower levels of bacterial production than maple mesocosms. This bottom-up effect of maple litter on wood frogs then appeared to affect other amphibians and Zooplankton through a complex series of interactions. These data suggest that litter composition impacted the performance of most trophic groups by altering the processing of energy in this system, thereby destabilizing species interactions throughout the food web. Therefore, "subtle" compositional shifts in the forest have the potential to influence communities that rely upon leaf litter inputs as a primary source of energy.},

abstract = {Researchers commonly model nest density as a function of ecological variables, but nests, like birds, can be undetected while present. In the Nebraska Sandhills in 2007, we used the rope-drag method on previously located Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) nests to model nest-detection error and nest density. Detecting nests by rope dragging (commonly used for nests of grassland birds) is conditional on two primary sources of nest availability, adults attending nests and adults flushing from nests in response to disturbance from the rope, the behavioral cue necessary for nest detection. On the basis of our trials with rope dragging, the probability of adults attending nests was 0.46. The probability of trials eliciting flight responses from adults was 0.19, indicating that observed estimates of nest density were subject to detection error and negatively biased. We compared our ability to detect differences in nest densities between two habitat types with a statistical power analysis, using (1) t-tests with estimates of apparent, uncorrected density and (2) a Bayesian hierarchical model incorporating nest-detection error. Our power analysis indicates that accounting for detection error in a hierarchical model increased statistical power for revealing differences in nest densities by habitat type. We discuss mechanisms underlying detection error for nests of grassland birds and make recommendations for sampling and modeling to maximize the reality of models for nest detectability and density.},

The daily loss rates are expressed as exponential coefficients after the data are fitted by least squares. Comparisons are made between two sites on a small hardwater trout stream during two seasons. Leaf processing rates form a continuum from a low of 0.5{\%}/day to a high of 2.0{\%}/day. Differences between species of leaf are observed, but significant differences between fall and winter processing and between the two sites are not. The response of the invertebrate community to differences in leaf species is investigated using controlled, artificial streams where significant differences in the effect of the invertebrates are related to the ability ofthe leaf to be processed. Evidence suggests that differential invertebrate colonization of leaf packs is a function of microbial colonization and conditioning. The data are used to develop a general scheme of leaf pack processing.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by ASME. Just as in conventional injection molding of plastics, process simulations are an effective and interesting tool in the area of microinjection molding. They can be applied in order to optimize and assist the design of the microplastic part, the mold, and the actual process. Available simulation software is however actually made for macroscopic injection molding. By means of the correct implementation and careful modeling strategy though, it can also be applied to microplastic parts, as it is shown in the present work. Process simulations were applied to two microfluidic devices (a microfluidic distributor and a mixer). The paper describes how the two devices were meshed in the simulations software to obtain a proper simulation model and where the challenges arose. One of the main goals of the simulations was the investigation of the filling of the parts. Great emphasis was also on the optimization of selected gate designs for both plastic parts. Subsequently, the simulation results were used to answer the question which gate design was the most appropriate with regard to the process window, polymer flow, and part quality. This finally led to an optimization of the design and the realization of this design in practice as actual steel mold. Additionally, the simulation results were critically discussed and possible improvements and limitations of the gained results and the deployed software were described. Ultimately, the simulation results were validated by cross-checking the flow front behavior of the polymer flow predicted by the simulation with the actual flow front at different time steps. These were realized by molding short shots with the realized molds and were compared to the simulations at the global, i.e., part level and at the local, i.e. feature level.},

abstract = {Stepwise regression building procedures are commonly used applied statistical tools, despite their well-known drawbacks. While many of their limitations have been widely discussed in the literature, other aspects of the use of individual statistical fit measures, especially in high-dimensional stepwise regression settings, have not. Giving primacy to individual fit, as is done with p-values and R 2 , when group fit may be the larger concern, can lead to misguided decision making. One of the most consequential uses of stepwise regression is in health care, where these tools allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to health plans enrolling individuals with different predicted health care costs. The main goal of this "risk adjustment" system is to convey incentives to health plans such that they provide health care services fairly, a component of which is not to discriminate in access or care for persons or groups likely to be expensive. We address some specific limitations of p-values and R 2 for high-dimensional stepwise regression in this policy problem through an illustrated example by additionally considering a group-level fairness metric.

@article{Greenberg2019,
abstract = {Trade routes have shaped human history by connecting distant civilizations, allowing the exchange of materials, technology, and people, but also diseases ([ 1 ][2]). Pathogens have been frequent hitchhikers, bringing them in contact with new hosts that provide the fuel for epidemic outbreaks of disease. Humans are not the only victims of trade-driven diseases, but scientists have only recently begun to appreciate the risk to biodiversity of inadvertently introducing new pathogens to na{\"{i}}ve evolutionary arenas. On page 1459 of this issue, Scheele et al. ([ 2 ][3]) demonstrate the consequences of globalized pathogen exchange by reconstructing the hidden history of disease-driven declines and extinctions for hundreds of amphibian species. Three decades ago, biologists began to report the decline or extinction of amphibian populations around the world. This concerted global phenomenon spawned a proliferation of hypotheses ([ 3 ][4]), especially to explain “enigmatic” declines in remote places, where neither habitat loss nor direct exploitation were apparent ([ 4 ][5]). The suspected culprit was a species new to science: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen found in amphibian skin ([ 5 ][6]) that belongs to the chytrids, a group of otherwise benign soil and water fungi. Bd is one of two species responsible for chytridiomycosis, the disease that appeared to be causing mass die-offs of amphibians. Bd is present in much of the world, but in the past century, a group of pathogenic strains originated in and spread from Asia; this spread coincided with the expansion of the global trade in live amphibians (see the figure) ([ 6 ][7]). Scientists have only been able to guess at the scale of damage caused by Bd to amphibian populations across the world, mostly because the baseline population data needed to decipher where and when species were lost through this disease have not been available. Scheele et al. overcame these data limitations to reconstruct the biodiversity impact of the global spread of pathogenic Bd. They compiled a detailed dataset of chytridiomycosis-associated declines from both published records and interviews with regional experts around the world. They estimate that chytridiomycosis has contributed to the decline or extinction of at least 501 amphibian species, earning Bd the inauspicious title of the most destructive pathogen for biodiversity ever recorded. The analysis suggests that of the 501 species, 90 are presumably extinct, with another 124 suffering severe declines. Many of these species belong to a few particularly susceptible frog lineages. ![Figure][8]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} Global trade in amphibians Since 1980, trade in amphibians that are listed under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) has risen from a few hundred to tens of thousands per year. The flow of live amphibians over the same time period is global in extent. This trade flow also likely represents only a small fraction of the total global amphibian trade, because only a subset of amphibian species are listed under CITES. All data are from TRAFFIC, the global network that monitors wildlife trade. GRAPHIC: N. CARY/ SCIENCE Because ecology and life history shape the susceptibility of species to Bd, the authors used their dataset to test for commonalities in species loss across six continents. The results suggest that large-bodied, range-restricted, and aquatic-associated species are most at risk of severe declines from chytridiomycosis. This information is vital for identifying regions that have the right environmental conditions for Bd and many potential hosts and where pathogen introduction could thus trigger extinctions. This information is particularly relevant given concern about the spread of pathogenic Bd strains to amphibian evolutionary hotspots where the pathogen is thought to be absent or rare, mainly oceanic islands like Papua New Guinea and Madagascar ([ 7 ][9]). The authors' data also suggest that chytridiomycosis-associated declines peaked in the 1980s in many regions, just as scientists were beginning to note these enigmatic losses ([ 3 ][4]). They conclude that the severity of declines may be dwindling over time. It remains unclear whether this is a sign of hosts and pathogen achieving a stable co-existence or merely a lull after the first of many waves of outbreaks. In many respects, Bd possesses the perfect recipe to drive its hosts to extinction. It is a generalist pathogen that infects many different hosts ([ 2 ][3], [ 7 ][9]), some of its hosts serve as highly tolerant reservoirs while infected ([ 8 ][10]), and it is highly transmissible through water, where it has the potential to interact with many amphibian species. Even against these poor odds, it seems that a stable host-pathogen system can develop in some amphibian assemblages ([ 9 ][11]), raising hope that either host or pathogen evolution may eventually stabilize the interaction. However, Scheele et al. ([ 2 ][3]) note that only 20{\%} of the affected species show signs of population recovery. If there is a stable host-pathogen equilibrium, it may take many years to materialize. Scientific understanding of Bd is still unfolding decades after its discovery ([ 5 ][6]–[ 7 ][9]), raising the ominous possibility that our ability to react to complex cases of biodiversity decline may always lag behind the emergence of threats. As studies such as that by Scheele et al. reconstruct what is already lost, there is a critical need to leverage these data into proactive management that considers multiple threats. Bd is but one more nail in the coffin for the state of amphibians globally. Habitat loss, exploitation, and climate change remain the main threats for thousands of species ([ 3 ][4]). These stressors often act in concert, but clear management actions exist to address at least some of them: protect habitat, limit collection of wild populations, and restrict trade. By contrast, there appear to be few viable management actions available once pathogenic Bd strains have established ([ 10 ][12]); if trade restrictions fail, then the only hope will be that evolutionary rescue can save at least some species. Moving forward, conservationists must carefully consider what management solutions are going to be most effective for each region, with habitat loss, climate change, and pathogen introduction all simultaneously threatening amphibian diversity. Unless the winds of wildlife trade shift considerably in the near future, the expanding rate of biotic exchange suggests that there will be greater opportunities for once-isolated pathogens to proliferate across the globe. It is troubling that Bd had apparently spread globally long before it was identified by scientists ([ 5 ][6]) or before any action could be taken. Although technology and knowledge have improved, biosurveillance may ultimately be ineffective, given the potentially vast diversity of currently unknown pathogens ([ 11 ][13]). Though Bd is likely exceptional, owing to its aforementioned traits, it may still be a harbinger of other disease outbreaks to come as humans continue to inadvertently spread pathogens around the world. The study by Scheele et al. ([ 2 ][3]) shows that the consequences of these exchanges can be far reaching and devastating for biodiversity. Just as trade-driven diseases have left their mark on our own history ([ 1 ][2]), so too has the human-mediated spread of wildlife pathogens already begun to reshape the evolutionary history of life on Earth.},

With this study, we use novel methodological approaches to map the cultural ecosystem service landscape aesthetics for its enhanced consideration in land-use policies. Our study uses expert-based participatory mapping and crowd-sourced (social media) photo data to examine the spatial distribution of landscape aesthetics in the Province of Barcelona, Catalonia. We distinguish the capacity and flow of landscape aesthetics. Landscape aesthetics capacity was assessed through spatial multi-criteria evaluation, consisting of a viewshed analysis and an expert-based selection and weighting of landscape features. Landscape aesthetics flow, i.e., people's actual appreciation of landscape aesthetics, was assessed by analysing a sample of 13,460 geolocated photographs from the social media platform Flickr. Our results uncover a substantial mismatch between landscape aesthetics capacity and flow. While landscape aesthetics capacity is widely distributed across the case study area, landscape aesthetics flow is (with few exceptions) mostly concentrated in urban and periurban areas. The main insights for land-use policies derived from our results are twofold. On one hand, landscape aesthetics flow seems less dependent on ‘pristine nature' than experts and planners assume, while the complex integration of green and grey landscape features plays a critical role. On the other hand, urban and periurban landscapes as key landscape aesthetics providers should receive additional attention in land-use policies.},

Through a series of misting perturbations, whole-tree resistances (R), capacitances (C) and time constants (tau) were determined from time series sap flux data in eastern hemlock and black birch. Black birch trees responded more rapidly to environmental perturbations than eastern hemlock. Utilizing the step function after applied treatments, whole-tree tau ranged between 9.4 and 24.8 min in eastern hemlock trees compared with 5.9 to 10.5 min in black birch. Species was not a significant predictor of R or C when controlling for tree size. In both species, R decreased with sapwood area and C increased.

Historically, the tallgrass prairie burned every 2-3 yr on average, but current land managers have altered burn regimes, resulting in a range of habitats from annually burned to long-term unburned. We used drift fence/funnel trap arrays and coverboards to estimate species richness, evenness, and diversity of herpetofauna within three different burn regimes: annual, 4-yr, and long-term unburned at Konza Prairie Biological Station, Riley County, Kansas. During the spring and fall of 2003-2004, 315 individuals from 20 species were captured across all burn regimes. Herpetofaunal species richness, evenness, and diversity estimates were not different between the three burn treatments. However, because of species-specific responses to individual burn regimes, community composition was significantly different between the habitats ([chi]2 = 158.19, df = 20, P {\textless} 0.001). Four species exhibited preferences among burn regimes, which differed significantly from independent assortment, with Eumeces obsoletus and Phrynosoma cornutum preferring annual burn treatments, Scincella lateralis preferring 4-yr burn treatments, and Diadophis punctatus preferring long-term unburned treatments. Species-specific responses were likely because of changes in vegetation structure and microhabitat (temperature and moisture content) created through different frequencies of fire disturbances. Maximizing large-scale herpetofaunal diversity across the Flint Hills' rangelands could be accomplished by creating a large number of small scale habitat types through a mosaic style burning plan.},

The canopy of rain forest trees is believed by many to hold the key to the immense diversity of insects. In recent years the use of knock‐down insecticides to sample insects from rain forest canopy has revealed information on the canopy's arthropod inhabitants and community structure. The sampling techniques involved are outlined and data reviewed on taxonomic and guild structure, species abundance, body size and biomass of insects, and the faunal similarity of trees. Calculations by Erwin (1982), based on knock‐down insecticide studies of the beetle fauna of one species of Central American tree, suggest there may be 30 million species of tropical forest arthropods. Reanalysis of these calculations, using additional data, produces a range of possible estimates from about 10 to 80 million. The unknown range of plant host‐specificities of tropical insects is the main weakness of this method of calculation. Assessment of the faunal importance of the canopy in relation to that of other rain forest biotopes requires comparative quantitative studies. The preliminary results of one such simple study suggest that over 42 million arthropods may be found in a hectare of Seram rain forest (at the time of study), and that 70{\%} occur in the soil and leaf litter and 14{\%} in the canopy. They also suggest that Collembola and Acarina are the dominant groups in this hectare, and that there are as many ants as all the other insects (excluding Collembola).

Interactions from increasing temperatures, drought, native insects and pathogens, and uncharacteristically severe wildfire are resulting in forest mortality beyond the levels of 20th-century experience. Additional anthropogenic stressors, such as atmospheric pollution and invasive species, further weaken trees in some regions. Although continuing climate change will likely drive many areas of temperate forest toward large-scale transformations, management actions can help ease transitions and minimize losses of socially valued ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Sugar cane cultivation spanned over two centuries in Puerto Rico, at one time covering 14{\%} of the island's total area. The most productive plantations were located in alluvial valleys that were deforested before there was an opportunity to record the species composition and structural development of the original native forests. This has led to speculation about the nature of these forests. With the abandonment of sugar cane cultivation in the twentieth century, sugar cane fields have been converted to pastures and a variety of secondary forests. One of these is a new forest type dominated by Spathodea campanulata, an invasive, wind-dispersed, and evergreen or nearly deciduous introduced species. We studied three stands of these forests at ages 25-40 years old on moist alluvial sites and found high basal area, intermediate tree density, high Complexity Index, and relatively low species richness. We recorded 19 tree species with dbh {\textgreater} 2.5 cm and 25 understory species equivalent to a total of 31 species. Of these, 11 species were introduced and 20 were native, including two endemic tree species. The large tree stratum (dbh {\textgreater} 10 cm) had high dominance of S. campanulata, 6 tree species, and a mean height of 12 m. Compared to large trees, small trees ({\textgreater} 2.5 {\textless}10 cm dbh) had higher species richness, and less dominance, while the understory had the highest species richness and lowest dominance. In spite of centuries of cultivation, forest soils were nutrient-rich, which allowed trees to attain large diameters, and produce nutrient-rich litter. The structural parameters of alluvial S. campanulata forests are comparable with those of remnant alluvial moist forests elsewhere on the north coast of Puerto Rico but the species composition is different. Periodic inundation of these forests appears to favor flood-tolerant species such as S. campanulata, and extends the period of domination of this species relative to its behavior in other geologic substrates in Puerto Rico. This process is exacerbated by long-term and extensive history of cultivation that reduced the species pool of seed sources for alluvial forests in the region. It will be difficult to restore the species complement of the original native forests because the disturbance regime of alluvial sites in Puerto Rico will continue to favor the presence, albeit reduced, of introduced species in the mature phases of these forests.},

abstract = {Summary: Understanding space usage and resource selection is a primary focus of many studies of animal populations. Usually, such studies are based on location data obtained from telemetry, and resource selection functions (RSFs) are used for inference. Another important focus of wildlife research is estimation and modeling population size and density. Recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models accomplish this objective using individual encounter history data with auxiliary spatial information on location of capture. SCR models include encounter probability functions that are intuitively related to RSFs, but to date, no one has extended SCR models to allow for explicit inference about space usage and resource selection. In this paper we develop the first statistical framework for jointly modeling space usage, resource selection, and population density by integrating SCR data, such as from camera traps, mist-nets, or conventional catch traps, with resource selection data from telemetered individuals. We provide a framework for estimation based on marginal likelihood, wherein we estimate simultaneously the parameters of the SCR and RSF models. Our method leads to increases in precision for estimating parameters of ordinary SCR models. Importantly, we also find that SCR models alone can estimate parameters of RSFs and, as such, SCR methods can be used as the sole source for studying space-usage; however, precision will be higher when telemetry data are available. Finally, we find that SCR models using standard symmetric and stationary encounter probability models may not fully explain variation in encounter probability due to space usage, and therefore produce biased estimates of density when animal space usage is related to resource selection. Consequently, it is important that space usage be taken into consideration, if possible, in studies focused on estimating density using capture-recapture methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Species interactions are dynamic processes that vary across environmental and ecological contexts, and operate across scale boundaries, making them difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, ecologists are increasingly interested in inferring species interactions from observational data using statistical analyses of their spatial co‐occurrence patterns. Trophic interactions present a particular challenge, as predators and prey may frequently or rarely co‐occur, depending on the spatial or temporal scale of observation. In this study, we investigate the accuracy of inferred interactions among species that both compete and trophically interact. We utilized a long‐term dataset of pond‐breeding amphibian co‐occurrences from Mt Rainier National Park (Washington, USA) and compiled a new dataset of their empirical interactions from the literature. We compared the accuracy of four statistical methods in inferring these known species interactions from spatial associations. We then used the best performing statistical method, the Markov network, to further investigate the sensitivity of interaction inference to spatial scale‐dependence and the presence of predators. We show that co‐occurrence methods are generally inaccurate when estimating trophic interactions. Further the strength and sign of inferred interactions were dependent upon the spatial scale of observation and predator presence influenced the detectability of competitive interactions among prey species. However, co‐occurrence analysis revealed new patterns of spatial association among pairs of species with known interactions. Overall, our study highlights a limiting frontier in co‐occurrence theory and the disconnect between widely implemented methodologies and their ability to accurately infer interactions in trophically‐structured communities.},

abstract = {Much of the primary forest in the eastern United States that was converted to farmland between 1600 and 1900 has reverted back to second growth forest as a result of agriculture abandonment. This reversion back to forest gives soil productivity a chance to recover, though the rates of recovery are not well understood. Understanding the legacy effects of past disturbances like agriculture can provide important insights to support ecological restoration efforts on disturbed soils. Our goal with this study was to further understand the effects of forest development on soil productivity after agriculture abandonment. We used a chronosequence approach to examine soil properties over a 60-year temporal scale of forest development on abandoned agricultural lands in Saratoga and Rensselaer Counties in New York, U.S.A. We measured soil properties within this chronosequence to test the hypothesis that there would be measurable recoveries of soil physical properties and fertility over time. We observed rapid recovery of physical properties (lower bulk density and higher macroporosity) of surface soils within 5–10 years after agricultural abandonment. However, we found a legacy effect of agricultural compaction still evident in subsoils, with soil strength measurements indicating that past agricultural practices still limited root growth 55–60 years after abandonment. Soil percent organic matter and mineralizable nitrogen (N) both increased with forest development, but biomass accumulation may be slowed by limited root growth in the subsoil due to high strength. We recommend assessing subsoil physical properties when developing ecological restoration plans for agricultural lands.},

abstract = {Landscape modification (loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitat) is a universal form of human-induced rapid environmental change that creates strong spatial variation in environmental conditions. Behaviourally mediated responses to landscape modification may generate behavioural divergence among populations along environmental gradients. We tested whether movement behaviour of red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, is repeatable and whether it varies within and between forest stands of different ages in a fragmented landscape in New York, U.S.A. Water loss is a major constraint on P.??cinereus mobility, and forest fragmentation creates spatial variation in desiccation risk. We quantified multiple components of individual movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment in the laboratory and used ordination to identify behavioural variation among individuals in multivariate space. We tested for repeatability of individual behaviour and then examined behavioural differences between individuals captured from populations at two spatial scales where desiccation risk was expected to vary: (1) between edge and interior locations within forest stands and (2) between forest stands varying in time since agricultural abandonment. Variation in movement behaviour among individuals was characterized by three components: total movement activity (e.g. surface activity, distance moved, boundary crossings), substrate use (time on moist soil versus dry sand) and latency to initial movement. Each behavioural component was significantly repeatable. At the population level, individuals from old forest stands (???77 years) showed greater movement activity than individuals from young stands. Movement behaviour did not differ between individuals from edge and interior locations within forest stands. Our results demonstrate that P.??cinereus individuals show consistent differences in movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment. Moreover, we show that movement behaviour can be spatially structured within fragmented landscapes, but that behavioural divergence among populations depends on spatial scale.},
annote = {Cosentino and Droney examined whether activity patterns of Plethodon cinereus are influenced by landscape setting in a laboratory experiement. They obtained salamanders from replicates of forest ages (primary vs secondary) and forest locations (edge vs interior) at FLNF and conducted behavioral trials with artificial substrates to measurement activity patterns. Response variables were reduced to three PCA axis that represent (1) movement activity, (2) substrate-use, and (3) latency. Salamanders from older forests moved at greater rates than those from younger forests. There was no effect of forest location (edge vs interior) on activity. Salamanders displayed repeatable individual variation in activity patterns, suggesting that there is some behavioral heterogeneity in salamander populations. Potential mechanisms for landscape effects on movement patterns may be local adaptations to dessication risks, social processes (i.e., density-dependence), or nonrandom gene flow inherited from colonization of regenerating forests.},

Regression modelling was used to analyse the visitation to thirty-five national parks in Finland. The results demonstrated that recreation opportunities, the number of biotopes, the provision of trails and the park's age increase the number of visits, while the park location in relation to the population only has a significant effect in southern Finland. The results imply the dual role of national parks as resource-based destinations if the natural characteristics are outstanding, but also as more user-oriented areas fulfilling recreation needs in the most populated parts of the country. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

However, where males provide extensive paternal care, the removal of even a few individuals could harm the population as a whole. In species such as lions, excessive trophy hunting could theoretically cause male replacements (and associated infanticide) to become sufficiently common to prevent cubs reaching adulthood. Here we simulate the population consequences of lion trophy hunting using a spatially explicit, individual-based, stochastic model parameterized with 40 years of demographic data from northern Tanzania. Although our simulations confirm that infanticide increases the risk of population extinction, trophy hunting could be sustained simply by hunting males above a minimum age threshold, and this strategy maximizes both the quantity and the quality of the long-term kill. We present a simple non-invasive technique for estimating lion age in populations lacking long-term records, and suggest that quotas would be unnecessary in any male-only trophy species where age determination could be reliably implemented.},

Nineteen species of amphibians (15 anurans and 4 caudates) were documented within the Refuge, including one protected species, the Gopher Frog Rana capito. We also collected 1 y of monitoring data for amphibian populations and incorporated the results into the inventory. Detection probabilities and site occupancy estimates for four species, the Pinewoods Treefrog (Hyla femoralis), Pig Frog (Rana grylio), Southern Leopard Frog (R. sphenocephala) and Carpenter Frog (R virgatipes) are presented here. Detection probabilities observed in this study indicate that spring and summer surveys offer the best opportunity to detect these species in the Refuge. Results of the inventory suggest that substantial changes may have occurred in the amphibian fauna within and adjacent to the swamp. However, monitoring the amphibian community of Okefenokee Swamp will prove difficult because of the logistical challenges associated with a rigorous statistical assessment of status and trends.},

Metabarcoding promises quicker, cheaper, and more accurate assessments of biodiversity in groups that are difficult to assess by traditional methods, while sequencing low-quality DNA extends the range of useable materials to include museum specimens, archeological remains, and environmental samples. Genomic and transcriptomic data can be used to assess the potential of populations to adapt to new challenges. In the near future, gene-editing tools may help endangered species cope with change, while gene drives control unwanted species and help wanted ones. De-extinction has become a serious prospect.},

abstract = {Conservation of fauna breeding in vernal pools is challenging given their complex life histories. Many species, including the widespread North American Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica), require both aquatic and terrestrial habitat, yet insufficient information exists about movements between these environments, nor fine-scale selection patterns within them. To inform conservation planning, we conducted a radio-telemetry study of seasonal patterns of Wood Frog movements and habitat selection in southern Maine. Forty-three frogs were tracked an average of 25.6 days each, April to November 2003. In early spring, Wood Frogs generally selected damp leaf litter retreats on the margins of breeding pools. Following breeding, frogs selected forested wetlands (9.3{\%} of the landscape) over forested uplands (90.7{\%} of the landscape) in 75.3{\%} of radio locations (N 5 544). Postbreeding movements from breeding pools to nearby, closed-canopy, forested wetlands ranged from 102–340 m (median 169m, N 5 8) and included stopovers in upland forest floors ranging from one to 17 days (median two days, N 5 7). Summer refugia were characterized by shady, moist (nonaquatic), and sphagnum-dominated microhabitats. In urbanizing areas, we recommend a shift from a core-habitat conservation model to a spatially explicit approach that considers pool-breeding amphibian habitat as a network of migration-connected habitat elements (e.g., breeding pools, upland forest, nearby forested wetlands). In our study, this approach reduced the amount of land potentially requiring protection by . 2/3 from that of core habitat models. With the rapid dissemination of GIS technology, spatially explicit planning for pool-breeding amphibians is increasingly feasible},

To do so, we examined interactions between endangered giant tortoises (Geochelone nigra hoodensis), currently being reintroduced to Isla Espa{\~{n}}ola, Gal{\'{a}}pagos, and an arboreal cactus (Opuntia megasperma var. megasperma), which is itself endangered and a keystone resource for many animals on the island. We collected information on spatial patterns of occurrence of cacti, tortoises, and woody vegetation and compared recruitment of juvenile cacti in areas occupied versus unoccupied by tortoises. Reintroduced tortoises appeared to suppress cactus recruitment near the few remaining adult cacti at the study site, but facilitate it at longer distances, with tortoise–cactus interactions mediated by the presence of woody vegetation, which likely alters tortoise movements and thereby patterns of cactus seed dispersal. The net effect of tortoises on cacti appeared to be positive insofar as tortoise presence was associated with greater recruitment of juveniles into cactus populations. Our study provides support for reintroducing endangered reptiles and other animals to aid ecosystem restoration in areas where they might once have played an important role in grazing upon and dispersing plants.},

abstract = {Conservation practice is informed by science, but also reflects ethical beliefs about how we ought to value and interact with the Earth's biota. As human activities continue to drive extinctions and diminish critical life‐sustaining ecosystem processes, achieving conservation goals becomes increasingly urgent. In our determination to react decisively, conservation challenges can be handled without due deliberation, particularly when wildlife individuals are sacrificed “for the greater good” of wildlife collectives (populations, species, ecosystems). With growing recognition of the widespread sentience and sapience of many nonhuman animals, standard conservation practices that categorically prioritize collectives without due consideration for the wellbeing of individuals are ethically untenable. Here we highlight three overarching ethical orientations characterizing current and historical practices in conservation that suppress compassion: instrumentalism, collectivism, and nativism. We illustrate how establishing a commitment to compassion could re‐orient conservation in more ethically expansive directions, which incorporate recognition of the intrinsic value of wildlife, the sentience of nonhuman animals, and the values of novel ecosystems, introduced species and their members. A compassionate conservation approach allays practices that intentionally and unnecessarily harm wildlife individuals, while aligning with critical conservation goals. Although the urgency of achieving effective outcomes for solving major conservation problems may enhance the appeal of quick and harsh measures, the costs are too high. Continuing to justify moral indifference when causing the suffering of wildlife individuals, particularly those who possess sophisticated capacities for emotion, consciousness, and sociality, risks estranging conservation practice from prevailing, and appropriate, social values. As conservationists and compassionate beings, we must demonstrate concern for both the long‐term persistence of collectives and the wellbeing of individuals, prioritizing strategies that do both. },

abstract = {Conserving amphibian populations living in urban areas is challenging due to a lack of information about urban amphibian natural history, ecology, and responses to habitat management. To address these knowledge gaps, we used 10 years of monitoring data to investigate patterns of occupancy, detectability, and population turnover for sympatric Ambystoma laterale (Blue-spotted Salamanders) and A. tigrinum (Eastern Tiger Salamanders; hereafter Tiger Salamanders) inhabiting 26 suburban preserves in the third largest metropolitan area in the United States, Chicago. From 2009 to 2018 we conducted 2181 artificial cover object surveys at 158 randomly distributed monitoring points and detected Blue-spotted Salamanders 375 times and Tiger Salamanders 85 times. We constructed dynamic occupancy models and used an information theoretic approach to rank a priori candidate models containing landscape, survey, and management covariates. Blue-spotted Salamander occupancy was more than twice as high as Tiger Salamander occupancy. Detection probability for both species was substantially {\textless}1 and was influenced by both survey and landscape covariates. Prescribed fire was an important predictor of colonization for Blue-spotted Salamanders and both species exhibited higher rates of colonization at sites near breeding wetlands. Overall rates of turnover were low for both species. Our results reveal that salamander populations can persist in highly fragmented urban preserve systems. We recommend that urban land managers maintain a mosaic of forests and wetlands and consider the impacts of habitat management on non-target species (such as salamanders).},

abstract = {Managing for stand structural complexity in northern hardwood forests has been proposed as a method for promoting microhabitat characteristics important to eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). We evaluated the effects of alternate, structure-based silvicultural systems on red-backed salamander populations at two research sites in northwestern Vermont. Treatments included two uneven-aged approaches (single-tree selection and group-selection) and one unconventional approach, termed "structural complexity enhancement" (SCE), that promotes development of late-successional structure, including elevated levels of coarse woody debris (CWD). Treatments were applied to 2 ha units and were replicated two to four times depending on treatment. We surveyed red-backed salamanders with a natural cover search method of transects nested within vegetation plots 1 year after logging. Abundance estimates corrected for detection probability were calculated from survey data with a binomial mixture model. Abundance estimates differed between study areas and were influenced by forest structural characteristics. Model selection was conducted using Akaike Information Criteria, corrected for over-dispersed data and small sample size (QAICc). We found no difference in abundance as a response to treatment as a whole, suggesting that all of the uneven-aged silvicultural systems evaluated can maintain salamander populations after harvest. However, abundance was tied to specific structural habitat attributes associated with study plots within treatments. The most parsimonious model of habitat covariates included site, relative density of overstory trees, and density of more-decayed and less-decayed downed CWD. Abundance responded positively to the density of downed, well-decayed CWD and negatively to the density of poorly decayed CWD and to overstory relative density. CWD volume was not a strong predictor of salamander abundance. We conclude that structural complexity enhancement and the two uneven-aged approaches maintained important microhabitat characteristics for red-backed salamander populations in the short term. Over the long-term, given decay processes as a determinant of biological availability, forestry practices such as SCE that enhance CWD availability and recruitment may result in associated population responses. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

annote = {This study examined how Red-backed Salamanders respond to habitat conditions imposed by different forest management protocols in Vermont. VES were used to sample salamander abundances in sites that had different silvicultural treatments (single-tree selection, group-selection, and "structural complexity enhancement"). While the researchers didn't find any significant effect of treatment, they did find some effects of habitat conditions themselves on salamander abundances. They used AIC for model selection, using QAICc to account for model over-dispersion. Their highest ranking models revealed a positive relationship between CWD density and abundance. Contrary to previous studies, volume of CWD was not correlated with adundance. This may be explained by the territoriality of Red-backed Salamanders. A greater density of individual CWD objects may actually provide more habitat for this species, as individuals frequently compete over the same cover objects. The authors argue that structural complexity enhancement techniques may be beneficial to this species, as this method retains and promotes greater CWD densities in the short-term.

abstract = {Urbanisation currently threatens over one-third of the world's known amphibian species. The main threats of urbanisation to amphibian populations are habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and isolation, and degradation of habitat quality. A complex array of interacting biotic and abiotic factors impact amphibians in urban and urbanising landscapes. These can lead to a decrease in species richness and the abundance of individual species towards the centre of cities and towns. The ability of amphibians to disperse can be significantly reduced in urban and suburban landscapes. However, different species exhibit markedly different responses to urbanisation. Amphibian species that are habitat generalists or have relatively low dispersal requirements appear to be better able to survive in urban and suburban landscapes. There is insufficient information on the ecology of amphibians in urban and suburban areas, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics, despite worldwide declines reported over past decades. Future research of amphibians in urban and suburban landscapes would greatly benefit by using long-term studies at sites along urban-rural gradients, conducted at both local and landscape scales. Research needs to be directed to the developing world in the tropics and sub-tropics, which has the highest rates of urbanisation. Research into amphibian ecology and conservation in the urbanising world would be improved through experimental approaches to determine the proximate causes of species' responses to human modification of the landscape. Maintaining viable populations of amphibians in urban and suburban landscapes will require conservation strategies that consider key urbanisation processes (i.e. habitat availability and habitat quality) and the key responses and adaptations to urbanisation (i.e. species availability and species response). Conservation strategies for amphibians in urban and suburban landscapes need to include actions to prevent further loss and degradation of both terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and to reconnect the landscape to facilitate dispersal and long-term regional persistence of amphibian populations and communities.

abstract = {Land-use history can play a significant role in shaping forest communities. We considered the effects of agricultural land-use legacies on the distribution of non-native invasive plants a century after abandonment in a watershed in western North Carolina, USA. Forest sites that were previously in cultivation and abandoned ca. 1905 were compared with nearby reference sites that were never cultivated. The most common invasive plants were Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb., Microstegium vimineum Trin., and Lonicera japonica Thunb. Formerly cultivated sites and plots positioned downslope from roads had the most invasives. Soil cation concentration and pH were positively correlated with invasive presence and abundance. Historic agricultural plots where the successional tree Liriodendron tulipifera L. was dominant had the highest soil cation concentrations and soil pH and the greatest abundance of invasive plants. Disentangling the cause-effect relationships between land-use history, the biotic community, and the abiotic template presents a challenge, but understanding the role of land-use legacies may provide important insights regarding the mechanisms underlying the establishment and spread of invasive plants in forest ecosystems. Our results suggest that land-use history at Bent Creek may be facilitating plant invasion indirectly by causing a shift in overstory community composition that in turn creates more suitable understory conditions for shade-tolerant invasive plants.},

abstract = {The herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles) of northwestern forests (U.S.A.) is diverse, and many species are locally abundant. Most forest amphibians west of the Cascade Mountain crest are associated with cool, cascading streams or coarse woody material on the forest floor, which are characteristics of mature forests. Extensive loss and fragmentation of habitat resulted from logging across approximately 50{\%} of old- growth forests in northern California and approximately 80{\%} of stands in Oregon and Washington. There is a complex landscape mosaic and overlap of northern and southern biotic elements in the Klamath-Siskiyou Region along the Oregon and California border, creating a biodiversity hotspot. The region experiences many low-severity fires annually, punctuated by periodic major fires, including the Biscuit fire, the largest in North America in 2002. In the fire's northern portion, severe fire occurred on {\textgreater}50{\%} of stands of young, managed trees but on only about 25–33{\%} of old-growth stands. This suggests that the legacy of timber harvest may produce fire-prone stands. Calls for prescribed fire and thinning to reduce fuel loads will remove large amounts of coarse woody material from forests, which reduces cover for amphibians and alters nutrient inputs to streams. Our preliminary evidence suggests no negative effects of wildfire on terrestrial amphibians, but stream amphibians decrease following wildfire. Most reptiles are adapted to open terrain, so fire usually improves their habitat. Today, the challenge is to maintain biodiversity in western forests in the face of intense political pressures designed to “prevent” catastrophic fires. We need a dedicated research effort to understanding how fire affects biota and to proactively investigate outcomes of fuel-reduction management on wildlife in western forests.},

abstract = {We investigated the response of pond-breeding amphibian assemblages to wetland hydroperiod and associ- ated predator changes (invertebrates (abundance and richness) and fish (presence/absence)) in relatively undisturbed landscapes in southern New Hampshire, U.S.A. We sampled 42 wetlands for larval amphibians in 14 spatial blocks (each with a short-, intermediate-, and permanent-hydroperiod wetland) in 1998 and 1999. Assemblages in short- hydroperiod wetlands ({\textless}4 months) were depauperate (4 species only) compared with intermediate-hydroperiod (non- permanent but {\textgreater}4 months) and permanent wetlands, which included 7 and 9 species, respectively. Total amphibian abundance did not vary among hydroperiod categories. Species distributions along the hydrological gradient also dif- fered. Rana sylvatica dominated wetlands with short and intermediate hydroperiods, whereas Rana catesbeiana, Bufo americanus, Rana clamitans, and Pseudacris crucifer dominated in those with a longer hydroperiod. Among permanent wetlands, amphibian species richness and abundance did not differ with respect to the presence of predatory fish, al- though there were species-compositional differences. Amphibian species richness and abundance were positively corre- lated with the abundance and richness of predatory invertebrates, suggesting that both amphibian and macroinvertebrate predator assemblages may be responding similarly to differences in wetland characteristics (e.g., dissolved oxygen con- centration). Overall, our results indicate that wetland hydroperiod has an important influence on amphibian distribution and should be incorporated into regulations and legislation designed to protect biologically diverse isolated wetlands.},

abstract = {The fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (B. dendrobatidis) has emerged as a major agent of amphibian extinction, requiring conservation intervention for many susceptible species. Identifying susceptible species is challenging, but many aspects of species biology are predicted to influence the evolution of host resistance, tolerance, or avoidance strategies towards disease. In turn, we may expect species exhibiting these distinct strategies to differ in their ability to survive epizootic disease outbreaks. Here, we test for phylogenetic and trait-based patterns of B. dendrobatidis infection risk and infection intensity among 302 amphibian species by compiling a global data set of B. dendrobatidis infection surveys across 95 sites. We then use best-fit models that associate traits, taxonomy and environment with B. dendrobatidis infection risk and intensity to predict host disease mitigation strategies (tolerance, resistance, avoid-ance) for 122 Neotropical amphibian species that experienced epizootic B. dendroba-tidis outbreaks, and noted species persistence or extinction from these events. Aspects of amphibian species life history, habitat use and climatic niche were consistently linked to variation in B. dendrobatidis infection patterns across sites around the world. However, predicted B. dendrobatidis infection risk and intensity based on site environ-ment and species traits did not reveal a consistent pattern between the predicted host disease mitigation strategy and extinction outcome. This suggests that either tolerant or resistant species may have no advantage in ameliorating disease during epizootic events, or that other factors drive the persistence of amphibian populations during chytridiomycosis outbreaks. These results suggest that using a trait-based approach may allow us to identify species with resistance or tolerance to endemic B. dendroba-tidis infections, but that this approach may be insufficient to ultimately identify species at risk of extinction from epizootics.},

This study evaluated the Endoscopic Sinus Surgery Simulator (ES3; Lockheed Martin) as a tool for anatomic education. METHODS Two medical student groups (experimental, n = 8; control, n = 7) studied paranasal sinus anatomy using either the simulator or textbooks. Their knowledge was then tested on the identification of anatomic structures on a view of the nasal cavities. RESULTS The mean scores were 9.4 ± 0.5 and 5.1 ± 3.0 out of 10 for the simulator and textbook groups, respectively (P = .009). Moreover, the simulator group completed the test in a significantly shorter time, 5.9 ± 1.1 versus 8.3 ± 2.0 minutes (P = .021). A survey asking the students to rate their respective study modality did not materialize significant differences. CONCLUSION The ES3 can be an effective tool in teaching sinonasal anatomy. This study may help shape the future of anatomic education and the development of modern educational tools.},

abstract = {Clearcutting and other forest management practices that remove canopy and disturb ground cover may exacerbate the risk of desiccation, particularly for newly metamorphosed amphibians. We exam- ined dehydration rates of juvenile Mole Salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum) in relation to burrow avail- ability in four experimental forest management treatments. Juvenile salamanders (N 5 41) were confined to small enclosures in four treatments representing a range of habitat disturbance: clearcut with coarse woody debris (CWD) removed; clearcut with CWD retained; thinning; and an unharvested control of second-growth, mature loblolly pine. Half of the salamanders in each habitat treatment were provided with artificial burrows. Water loss over 72 h was significantly higher in the clearcut with CWD retained than in the other three treatments. Most water loss occurred during the first two nights, when salamanders may have been most active. Only 40{\%} of salamanders without burrows survived in the clearcuts, versus 90{\%} in the thinned stand and 100{\%} in the control. Ninety percent of the salamanders with access to a burrow survived in the clearcuts versus 100{\%} in the thinning and control. We found no correlation between soil moisture and water loss and attribute higher desiccation rates in the clearcuts to high temperatures ({\textgreater} 448C). Although habitat changes resulting from thinning did not lead to increased desiccation, complete canopy removal greatly increased risk of mortality caused by desiccation. Our results also demonstrate that this risk is strongly mediated by the availability of burrows.},
annote = {In their study, Rothermel and Luhring compared mole salamander desiccation and survival rates in stands with different forest harvesting treatments (clearcut-retained CWD, clearcut-removed CWD, thinning, control). Each salamander was provided with an independent enclosure, half of which had burrow access. The authors found that salamanders experience greater water loss and mortality in clearcut stands than in thinned or control stands. Burrows were seen to have a mediating effect on desiccation and survival - salamanders with access to burrows were healthier than salamanders without burrow access, except in control plots. A limitation of this study was its scale - enclosures were very small and did not allow salamanders access to retained CWD and the greater managed landscape as a whole. This trade off allowed the researchers to examine management effects on individuals rather than populations. 

Burrow availability can mitigate risk from other poor terrestrial habtiat features - like reduced litter and canopy cover.},

A primary research generalization in this field, the use-impact relationship, is commonly described as curvilinear, with proportionally more impact from initial recreation/tourism use. This finding has formed the basis of visitor management strategies in parks, wilderness, and protected areas in many parts of the world. In this paper, however, we argue that the current generalization may be an oversimplification derived from one ecological response: the response of vegetation cover in some plant communities to trampling. Use-response functions for other plant communities, wildlife, soils, and aquatic/marine systems, for example, can differ and require alternative management strategies for sustainable use. On the basis of the available literature, we propose several alternative response relationships. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

This paper evaluates the application of a specific research tool - Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework (SESF), which seeks to provide a basis for institutional crafting in the context of social-ecological systems (SES). We evaluate the application of the framework to empirical analysis against the background of some of its own ambitions and a set of conventional criteria for evaluating research. We found 20 publications that have applied the SESF. The SESF proved useful in articles that use it for explanation, though they often played down the question of how they selected explanatory variables. Across cases, application of the SESF fared poorly in terms of consistency of use and measurement of categories. Moreover, generalization on an analytical level is similarly compromised by lack of confidence among authors concerning how to apply the set-theoretic principles that underlie the nested structure of the framework. In sum, much work remains in order to realize the ambitions for research that the SESF has laid out and to fully use its associated, path-breaking, interdisciplinary, and policy-relevant innovations. Notwithstanding these critical remarks, recent work in this area seems highly promising, not least for policy practice and institutional crafting.},

abstract = {Somatic growth rates are critical to the population dynamics of long-lived ectotherms. While the von Bertalanffy (VB) growth curve has been used extensively to model growth of such animals, the conventional form of the model fails to account for individual variation or for changes in resource allocation after sexual maturation. Bayesian modelling has recently been used in fisheries research to fit a modification of the VB model that is both hierarchical (allowing individual variation in growth parameters) and biphasic (allowing an age-specific change in growth rate). We extend this approach by developing a range of hierarchical biphasic models allowing a size- rather than age-dependent change of one or more growth parameters in one or both sexes. We applied the approach to a long-term data set of growth measurements for snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), as data on nesting status show females begin nesting predictably at about 24. cm carapace length. The data consisted of 1996 carapace-length measurements taken from 1972 to 2005 in Algonquin Park, Canada, from 317 individual turtles. These included 24 turtles of known age, most of which were juveniles of unknown sex, and 293 turtles of unknown age, most of which were adults of known sex. The modelling revealed substantial individual variation in both the asymptotic size (a) and growth rate (k) parameter, and clear evidence of biphasic growth. The model that best explained the data (based on DIC) was that males and females grow similarly until they reach 24. cm, after which females shift trajectory towards a reduced asymptotic size target. The number of years taken to reach 24. cm was estimated to range from 11 to 44 years in 95{\%} of individuals, with asymptotic size ranging from 38.2 to 40.9 in males and 31.0 to 33.6 in females. Our approach is applicable to a range of long-lived ectotherms likely to have size-dependent biphasic growth, and provides essential information for modelling the long-term dynamics of populations under threat. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Conflicts in the results of previous anal- yses of the Galapagos flora are reconciled and are shown to be the result of using different species numbers and physiographic parameter measurements. The idea that Galapagos plant species numbers largely reflect conditions in the archipelago during the Pleistocene glaciations (i.e., that relaxation times are very long) is criticized, and the more parsimonious alternative, that they reflect recent conditions, is proposed. Generalizations about factors determining species numbers that are based on multiple regression and correlation are precarious. The number of botanical collecting trips to each of the Galapagos Islands is a better predictor of species numbers than are area, elevation, or isolation.},

abstract = {The concept of landscape legacies has been examined extensively in terrestrial ecosystems and has led to a greater understanding of contemporary ecosystem processes. However, although stream ecosystems are tightly coupled with their catchments and, thus, probably are affected strongly by historical catchment conditions, few studies have directly examined the importance of landuse legacies on streams.We examined relationships between historical land use (1944) and contemporary (2000–2003) stream physical, chemical, and biological conditions after accounting for the influences of contemporary land use (1999) and natural landscape (catchment size) variation in 12 small streams at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA. Most stream variables showed strong relationships with contemporary land use and catchment size; however, after accounting for these factors, residual variation in many variables remained significantly related to historical land use. Residual variation in benthic particulate organic matter, diatom density, {\%} of diatoms in Eunotia spp., fish density in runs, and whole-stream gross primary productivity correlated negatively, whereas streamwater pH correlated positively, with residual variation in fraction of disturbed land in catchments in 1944 (i.e., bare ground and unpaved road cover). Residual variation in {\%} recovering land (i.e., early successional vegetation) in 1944 was correlated positively with residual variation in streambed instability, a macroinvertebrate biotic index, and fish richness, but correlated negatively with residual variation in most benthic macroinvertebrate metrics examined (e.g., Chironomidae and total richness, Shannon diversity). In contrast, residual variation in whole-stream respiration rates was not explained by historical land use. Our results suggest that historical land use continues to influence important physical and chemical variables in these streams, and in turn, probably influences associated biota. Beyond providing insight into biotic interactions and their associations with environmental conditions, identification of landuse legacies also will improve understanding of stream impairment in contemporary minimally disturbed catchments, enabling more accurate assessment of reference conditions in studies of biotic integrity and restoration.},

abstract = {One of the largest old-growth forests in southern New England was recently "discovered" on the exposed upper slopes of Wachusett Mountain, Massachusetts, a heavily used recreational area located {\textless}80 km ({\textless}50 miles) from Boston. We analyzed historical records, dendroecological data, vegetation, and coarse woody debris to characterize the dynamics and development of four major old-growth stands on the mountain and explored the potential factors enabling these forests to survive and elude recognition as old-growth forests for {\textgreater}150 yr. Historical data suggest that most of the area's forests were composed of a mixture of Quercus rubra and northern hardwood species. Species abundances and recruitment dynamics in the four stands exhibit highly variable spatial and temporal patterns across sites that differ in aspect and exposure. Three uneven-aged hardwood stands contain Quercus rubra in the largest size classes, various amounts of Fagus grandifolia, Acer, and Betula species in the middle size classes, and dense thickets of several shrub species in the small size classes. Several of a set of randomly aged individuals of Q. rubra, B. lenta, and B. alleghaniensis are at or very near the maximum longevity known for these species. A Tsuga canadensis stand contains unimodal size and age distributions, with trees {\textless} 60-cm dbh and 100-300 yr old. Quercus rubra recruitment occurred on all sites from the 1600s through the early 1800s, when it dropped precipitously on most sites and was replaced by either Tsuga or Acer and Betula species. These recruitment changes were apparently driven by changes in disturbance regime over the last two centuries, from fire in the early record to hurricanes (1815 and 1938), and more recently, frequent wind, ice, and snow damage but no fire. Asynchronous tree-ring releases and suppression and relatively low amounts of coarse woody debris corroborate this interpretation. Chronic canopy damage produced short-statured and unusually gnarled trees, which gave the forest unusual resistance to severe winds from hurricanes, discouraged logging, and prevented the recognition of the forest's old-growth status despite its heavy recreational use.},

abstract = {Agricultural land-use legacies remain persistent determinants of
plant-community composition, despite extended periods of recovery in
postagricultural forests of New York. We surveyed the composition of
vascular plant species for 33 paired residual (unconverted) and
secondary (postagricultural) forest sites across three physiographic
regions in New York to assess the recovery of residual forest species in
secondary successional stands. There were 169 vascular plant species
recorded among the 33 study sites. The residual stands exhibited
slightly greater mean (6 SE) species richness (26.8 +/- 1.7 species per
site) than secondary-interior (21.4 +/- 1.2, P = 0.001) and
secondary-edge (24.1 +/- 1.6, P = 0.02) zones. Plant communities
differed across the three physiographic regions (P = 0.001) and by stand
history within regions (P = 0.004). Of the vascular plant species
occurring at our sites, 22 (13{\%}) were indicators of residual forest
stands and 27 (16{\%}) were indicators of secondary, postagricultural
forest stands. Within 10 to 25 m of the historic field-forest ecotones,
the relative frequencies of many residual woodland indicator species
fell to 0-20{\%} of the maxima they attained in the residual stands.
Ant-dispersed (myrmecochorous) taxa represented 23{\%} of residual and 0{\%}
of secondary forest indicators and exhibited lower migration rates (P {\textless}
0.001) than plants possessing other diaspore dispersal modes
(anemochory, zoochory, barochory). In addition to plant dispersal mode,
we found pH and forest-floor depth to be important determinants of plant
species. Our results indicate that impoverishment of plant communities
in postagricultural forests represent a regionally pervasive phenomenon
with important resource management implications in the eastern USA.
Residual woodlands remain important source populations for recovery of
herbaceous species in postagricultural landscapes. However, given the
slow historic recovery rates that we and others have observed in
postagricultural secondary forests, in addition to other contemporary
factors potentially inhibiting dispersal and establishment (e.g.,
herbivory, pollinator disruptions, invasive species), it seems likely
that active restoration efforts are needed to promote full recovery of
diverse, native temperate-forest herb communities.},

abstract = {Some of the first applications of transgenic trees in North America may be for the conservation or restoration of threatened forest trees that have been devastated by fungal pathogens or insect pests. In some cases, where resistance has yet to be found in the natural population of a tree species, incorporating genes from other organisms may offer the only hope for restoration. In others, transgenics may play a role as part of an integrated approach, along with conventional breeding or biocontrol agents. American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was wiped out as a canopy species by a fungal disease accidentally introduced into the United States around 1900. Similarly, American elm (Ulmus americana) virtually disappeared as a favored street tree from Northeastern U.S. cities after the introduction of the Dutch elm disease fungus in the 1940s. In both cases, progress has been made toward restoration via conventional techniques such as selection and propagation of tolerant cultivars (American elm) or breeding with a related resistant species (American chestnut). Recently, progress has also been made with development of systems for engineering antifungal candidate genes into these “heritage trees.” An Agrobacterium-leaf disk system has been used to produce transgenic American elm trees engineered with an antimicrobial peptide gene that may enhance resistance to Dutch elm disease. Two gene transfer systems have been developed for American chestnut using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of embryogenic cultures, setting the stage for the first tests of potential antifungal genes for their ability to confer resistance to the chestnut blight fungus. Despite the promise of transgenic approaches for restoration of these heritage trees, a number of technical, environmental, economic, and ethical questions remain to be addressed before such trees can be deployed, and the debate around these questions may be quite different from that associated with transgenic trees developed for other purposes.},

As corrected for altitude, latitude, and the $\delta$13C of atmospheric CO2, these data permit refined interpretation of MAP, paleodiet, and paleoecology of ecosystems dominated by C3 plants, either prior to 7-8 million years ago (Ma), or more recently at mid- to high latitudes. Twenty-nine published paleontological studies suggest preservational or scientific bias toward dry ecosystems, although wet ecosystems are also represented. Unambiguous isotopic evidence for C4 plants is lacking prior to 7-8 Ma, and hominid ecosystems at 4.4 Ma show no isotopic evidence for dense forests. Consideration of global plant biomass indicates that average $\delta$13C of C3 plants is commonly overestimated by approximately 2{\%}.},

The recent emergence of social media and other sources of 'big data' creates exciting alternative possibilities for assessing how people use nature for recreational purposes. In this study, we focus on 'geocaching', a worldwide outdoor game in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to hide and seek containers called 'geocaches.' We use the city of Leipzig (Germany) as a case study and focus on nature-related geocaches to explore short-term recreation as a cultural ecosystem service. We use georeferenced localities of geocaches and their visit rates as quantitative measures and combine them with a content analysis, as well as with quantitative results of an online survey. Using this data, we distinguish between revealed and stated preferences. We found that the density of geocaches was highest close to the city centre and that geocaching is indeed a type of local recreation and an urban ecosystem service, as green areas and experiences in nature are important for this activity. Stated and revealed preferences, however, often did not match for the different types of geocaches that we identified. While geocachers may have quite different motivations, the activity appears to be mostly done by young, well-educated people according to our surveys. In summary, geocaching data offer exciting opportunities to explore spatial gradients, as well as preferences and motivations regarding short-term recreation.},

Movement patterns were significantly different following clearcutting. More amphibians were exiting clearcut sites and fewer were moving in. This effect was stronger in salamanaders than anurans, and the Green Frog was actually found to display the reverse behavior, indicating its greater tolerance to disturbance. Salamanders may be more capable of displaying behavioral shifts than anurans to disturbance. They may also experience lower mortality rates to clearcutting due to their use of subterannean refugia. },

abstract = {Abstract Hierarchical models (HMs) represent a sequence of probability models for dependent random variables, of which one is typically observed (this is the data), and one or more random variables are unobserved and thus latent. Typical examples of the latter are the occurrence or abundance state of a local population. To describe patterns in each random variable, we typically use linear models, and for parameters representing rates or probabilities, we use link transformations just like in generalized linear models (GLMs). To fully exploit the power of HMs, you therefore need to have a good practical understanding of both linear models and GLMs. This chapter provides an applied introduction to both topics, which are essential in all of applied statistical modeling. HMs naturally contain random effects—i.e., sets of parameters assumed to be drawn from some statistical distribution—hence, HMs can also be called mixed models. Mixed models are a confusing topic to many ecologists, and hence we briefly review random-effects, or mixed, models as well. Linear models express the effects of covariates on a response as a simple sum. The covariates may be continuous, as in a regression model, or categorical (factors), as in analysis of variance (ANOVA). Linear models are an extremely powerful and yet simple way to describe patterns in the expected response from some stochastic system—i.e., the thing we want to describe and understand with our statistical model. The combination of different covariates or factors, interactions, and polynomial terms of continuous covariates offer tremendous power to describe such patterns. GLMs extend the principle of linear models to responses that need not be normal, but may be Poisson, Bernoulli, or binomial, and hence to the modeling of counts, proportions, or probabilities. Random effects are sets of parameters, or latent variables, that are described as the outcome of a stochastic system, and hence are given a probability distribution in the statistical model. They are typically invoked for a variety of reasons that include the following: extending the scope of inference of an analysis, quantifying and partitioning variability in one set of parameters, quantifying and modeling covariability (correlations) between two or more sets of parameters, modeling hidden structure in the data, borrowing strength, and combining information from different studies or data sets. We give an example of a normal-normal mixed model and a Poisson-normal generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). This chapter is meant to provide an applied review of linear models, GLMs, and random effects regardless of the inference paradigm (frequentist or Bayesian), and we give R and BUGS code to fit all the models.},

abstract = {We review and synthesize information on invasions of nonnative forest insects and diseases in the United States, including their ecological and economic impacts, pathways of arrival, distribution within the United States, and policy options for reducing future invasions. Nonnative insects have accumulated in United States forests at a rate of ∼2.5 per yr over the last 150 yr. Currently the two major pathways of introduction are importation of live plants and wood packing material such as pallets and crates. Introduced insects and diseases occur in forests and cities throughout the United States, and the problem is particularly severe in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. Nonnative forest pests are the only disturbance agent that has effectively eliminated entire tree species or genera from United States forests within decades. The resulting shift in forest structure and species composition alters ecosystem functions such as productivity, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat. In urban and suburban areas, loss of trees from streets, yards, and parks affects aesthetics, property values, shading, stormwater runoff, and human health. The economic damage from nonnative pests is not yet fully known, but is likely in the billions of dollars per year, with the majority of this economic burden borne by municipalities and residential property owners. Current policies for preventing introductions are having positive effects but are insufficient to reduce the influx of pests in the face of burgeoning global trade. Options are available to strengthen the defenses against pest arrival and establishment, including measures taken in the exporting country prior to shipment, measures to ensure clean shipments of plants and wood products, inspections at ports of entry, and post-entry measures such as quarantines, surveillance, and eradication programs. Improved data collection procedures for inspections, greater data accessibility, and better reporting would support better evaluation of policy effectiveness. Lack of additional action places the nation, local municipalities, and property owners at high risk of further damaging and costly invasions. Adopting stronger policies to reduce establishments of new forest insects and diseases would shift the major costs of control to the source and alleviate the economic burden now borne by homeowners and municipalities.},

abstract = {In many respects, amphibian spatial dynamics resemble classical metapopulation models, in which subpopulations in breeding ponds blink in and out of existence and extinction and colonization rates are functions of pond spatial arrangement. This 'ponds-as-patches" view of amphibian spatial dynamics is useful in several respects. First, it highlights the importance of regional and landscape processes in determin- ing localpatterns of abundance. Second, it offers a straightforward, pond-based approach to monitoring and managing amphibian populations. For many species, however, the ponds-as-patches view may be an over- simplification and metapopulation structure may be more apparent than real. Changes in distribution may be caused by processes other than extinction and recolonization, and most extinctions probably result from deterministic factors, not stochastic processes. In addition, the effects of pond isolation appear to be impor- tant primarily in disturbed environments, and in many cases these isolation effects may be better explained by the distribution of terrestrial habitats than by the distribution of breeding ponds. These complications have important implications for both researchers and managers. For researchers, future efforts need to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of abundance and distributional change and patterns in amphibian pop- ulations. For managers, effective conservation strategies must successfully balance metapopulation consider- ations with careful attention to local habitat quality. Furthermore, translocations and active management may be indispensable tools for conserving amphibians in landscapes containing multiple breeding ponds.},
annote = {Extinction and colonization rates are functions of pond spatial arrangement. Applied and methodological perspectives support a metapopulation approach to amphibian ecology. The authors propose a “pond-as-patches” approach to metapopulation dynamics that includes four principles: (1) population dynamics due primarily to processes occurring at breeding ponds, (2) local extinction and recolonization of pond subpopulations are common occurences, (3) many local extinctions result from stochastic processes in otherwise suitable breeding habitats, (4) limited dispersal ability leads to effects of pond isolation on colonization, extinction, or occupancy. Evidence for terrestrial isolation effects stronger than evidence for aquatic isolation effects. “Pond occupancy may be more indicative of the spatial arrangement of terrestrial habitat than the arrangement of breeding ponds”},

abstract = {Bayesian hierarchical models were used to assess trends of harbor seals, Phoca vitulina richardsi, in Prince William Sound, Alaska, following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Data consisted of 4-10 replicate observations per year at 25 sites over 10 years. We had multiple objectives including estimating the effects of covariates on seal counts, and estimating trend and abundance, both per site and overall. We considered a Bayesian hierarchical model to meet our objectives The model consists of a Poisson regression model for each site. For each observation the logarithm of mean of the Poisson distribution was a linear model wit the following factors: (1) intercept for each site and year, (2) time of year, (3) time of day, (4) time relative to low tide, and (5) tide height. The intercept for each site was then given a linear trend model for year. As part of the hierarchical model, parameters for each site were given a prior distribution to summarize overall effects. Results showed that at most sites, (1) trend is down; counts decreased yearly, (2) counts decrease throughout August, (3) counts decrease throughout the day, (4) counts are at a maximum very near to low tide, and (5) counts decrease as the height of the low tide increases; however, there was considerable variation among sites. To get overall trend we used a weighted average of the trend at each site, where the weights depended on the overall abundance of a site. Results indicate at 3.3{\%} decrease per year over the time period.},

abstract = {A sediment budget was developed for a representative rural southeastern Piedmont watershed to estimate the relative importance of various sediment sources, particularly the contribution of agricultural sediments introduced to stream systems during the cotton-farming era (approximately 1820 to 1930 A.D.). The Murder Creek basin containing Monticello, Georgia was chosen because: 1) forestry and agriculture were and continue to be dominant land uses; 2) a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gage provided flow and suspended sediment records; and 3) the creek discharges into the Lake Sinclair reservoir (constructed 1949 to 1953), which could be used as a bedload sediment trap. Sediment rating curves, reservoir sediment deposition, and the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) erosion models were used to estimate suspended sediment export, bedload export, unpaved road erosion, and other surface erosion, respectively. Depths of historical agricultural sediment deposits were measured in stream cutbanks and floodplain auger holes. Historical row-crop agriculture led to floodplain deposition of a nearly-uniform 1.6 m (5.3 ft) of sediment, equivalent to 12.2 cm (0.40 ft) of topsoil over the watershed. The mass of cotton-farming sediments in valley storage was extremely large compared to current sediment export rates. At present sediment export rates, it would take six to ten millennia to remove all of the cotton-farming sediment in storage. This study suggests that the unstable streambanks, mobile sandy streambeds, and turbid conditions characteristic of modern Piedmont streams are largely a legacy of poor farming practices in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Estimated sediment exports exceed estimates of current inputs, and floodplain accretion rates and streambank conditions suggest streams have been in a state of net sediment export over the last 50 years.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology {\textcopyright} 2017 British Ecological Society Efficient and reliable methods for estimating animal density are essential to wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping is an increasingly popular tool in this area of wildlife research, with further potential arising from technological improvements, such as video-recording functions that allow for behavioural observation of animals. This information may be useful in the estimation of animal density, even without individual recognition. Although several models applicable to species lacking individual markings (i.e. unmarked populations) have been developed, a methodolo gy incorporating behavioural information from videos has not yet been established. We developed a likelihood-based model: the random encounter and staying time (REST) model. It is an extension of the random encounter model by Rowcliffe et al. (J Appl Ecol 45:1228, 2008). The REST model describes the relationship among staying time, trapping rate, and density, which is estimable using a frequentist or Bayesian approach. We tested the reliability and feasibility of the REST model using Monte Carlo simulations. We also applied the approach in the African rainforest and compared the results with those of a line-transect survey. The simulations showed that the REST model provided unbiased estimates of animal density. Even when animal movement speeds varied among individuals, and when animals travelled in pairs, the model provided unbiased density estimates. However, the REST model was vulnerable to unsynchronized activity patterns among individuals. Moreover, it is necessary to use a camera model with a fast and reliable infrared sensor and to set the camera trap's parameters appropriately (i.e. video length, delay period). The field survey showed that the staying time of two ungulate species in the African rainforest exhibited good fit with a temporal parametric distribution, and the REST model provided density estimates consistent with those of a line-transect survey. Synthesis and applications. The random encounter and staying time model provides better efficiency and higher feasibility than the random encounter model in estimating animal density without individual recognition. Careful application of the random encounter and staying time model provides the potential to estimate density of many ground-dwelling vertebrates lacking individually recognizable markings, and thus should be an effective method for population monitoring.},

abstract = {One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25{\%} of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.},

abstract = {Northern hardwood forests can exhibit considerable temporal stability in their species composition, which litterfall may help to maintain by modifying the soil environment to create an ecological inheritance. We evaluated the evidence for this niche-construction perspective by carrying out a spatially explicit analysis of redistribution of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) via leaf litterfall of the six dominant tree species in a temperate forest in northwest Connecticut, USA. We combined stem maps with litterfall measurements to fit models of leaf litterfall for individual species, and we chemically analyzed leaves, surface soil extractions, and unweathered soil particles. Analysis of elemental oxides in unweathered soil particles suggested that species did not differ in ability to gain access to rock-bound nutrients. Nevertheless, species had a significant effect on quantity of Ca cycled in litter-the two calcicoles (species with affinity for calcium-rich soils) occurred most commonly on the richest soils, and the Ca concentration in their senescent leaves increased sharply across the soil fertility gradient. No species effects on Mg or K redistribution were seen. Litter dispersal distances cut across calcium affinities: e.g., of the four calcifuges (plants with affinity for acidic soils) two had distant litter dispersal (modal dispersal distance {\textgreater}= 4 m) and two had close litter dispersal (modal dispersal distance {\textless}0.3 m). Dispersal distance was associated with leaf size: the three species with the smallest leaves had the most concentrated litterfall shadows. One of these, eastern hemlock, has a recognized ability to exclude other species in part by creating an acidic low-nutrient soil environment. Overall, the ability of trees to generate soil conditions that were aligned with their own resource use was expressed most clearly in the calcium content of their leaves. We concluded that tree-environment interactions at the site displayed several of the criteria for niche construction.},

abstract = {Summary 1. The ability to identify key ecological processes is important when solving applied problems. Increasingly, ecologists are adopting Akaike's information criterion (AIC) as a metric to help them assess and select among multiple process-based ecological models. Surprisingly, however, it is still unclear how best to incorporate AIC into the selection process in order to address the trade-off between maximizing the probability of retaining the most parsimonious model while minimizing the number of models retained. 2. Ecological count data are often observed to be overdispersed with respect to best-fitting models. Overdispersion is problematic when performing an AIC analysis, as it can result in selection of overly complex models which can lead to poor ecological inference. This paper describes and illustrates two approaches that deal effectively with overdispersion. The first approach involves modelling the causes of overdispersion implicitly using compound probability distributions. The second approach ignores the causes of overdispersion and uses quasi-AIC (QAIC) as a metric for model parsimony. 3. Simulations and a novel method that identifies the most parsimonious model are used to demonstrate the utility of the two overdispersion approaches within the context of two ecological examples. The first example addresses binomial data obtained from a study of fish survival (as related to habitat structure) and the second example addresses Poisson data obtained from a study of flower visitation by nectarivores. 4. Applying either overdispersion approach reduces the chance of selecting overly complex models, and both approaches result in very similar ecological inference. In addition, inference can be made more reliable by incorporating model nesting into the selection process (i.e. identifying which models are special cases of others), as it reduces the number of models selected without significantly reducing the probability of retaining the most parsimonious models. 5. Synthesis and applications . When data are overdispersed, inference can be improved by either modelling the causes of overdispersion or applying QAIC as a metric for model parsimony. Inference can also be improved by adopting a model filtering procedure based on how models are nested. The general simulation approach presented in this paper for identifying the most parsi- monious model, as defined by information theory, should help to improve our understanding of the reliability of model selection when using AIC, and help the development of better selection rules},

abstract = {A GIS model predicting the spatial distribution of terrestrial salamander abundance based on topography and forest age was developed using parameters derived from the literature. The model was tested by sampling salamander abundance across the full range of site conditions used in the model. A regression of the predictions of our GIS model against these sample data showed that the model has a modest but significant ability to predict both salamander abundance and mass per unit area. The model was used to assess the impacts of alternative management plans for the Hoosier National Forest (Indiana, USA) on salamanders. These plans differed in the spatial delineation of management areas where timber harvest was permitted, and the intensity of timber harvest within those management areas. The spatial pattern of forest openings produced by alternative forest management scenarios based on these plans was projected over 150 years using a timber-harvest simulator (HARVEST). We generated a predictive map of salamander abundance for each scenario over time, and summarized each map by calculating mean salamander abundance and the mean colonization distance (average distance from map cells with low predicted abundance to those with relatively high abundance). Projected salamander abundance was affected more by harvest rate (area harvested each decade) than by the management area boundaries. The alternatives had a varying effect on the mean distance salamanders would have to travel to colonize regenerating stands. Our GIS modeling approach is an example of a spatial analytical tool that could help resource management planners to evaluate the potential ecological impact of management alternatives. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

During the winter of 2006, male inflorescences and twigs of black birch had higher water contents than those of gray birch, and the inflorescences of black birch experienced greater frost kill than those of gray birch. Vessels diameters were greater in black than in gray birch, a difference associated with a higher incidence of winter xylem embolism, as indicated by reduced xylem hydraulic conductance. In both species, recovery of hydraulic conductance in twigs that survived the winter coincided with the development of root pressure. Frost kill to male inflorescences or associated damage to plant tissues may account for the difference between species in the effect of winter temperature on the time of first flowering.

abstract = {Estimating survival for highly secretive aquatic animals, such as stream salamanders, presents numerous challenges. Salamanders often spend a considerable time in refugia where they are difficult to capture. Few studies have calculated vital rates for stream salamanders, yet the need is substantial as they are threatened by a wide range of land-use stressors, especially urban development. In this study, we used 34 months of continuous field samples collected at an urban and undisturbed stream and robust design mark-recapture analysis to evaluate the importance of temporary emigration, capture response, and location on survival estimates of the salamander Desmognathus fuscus. We constructed a set of candidate models incorporating combinations of time- and location-varying capture and recapture probabilities, capture responses, temporary emigration, and survival estimates and ranked models using Akaike's Information Criterion. We found strong support for month-specific capture probabilities, recapture probabilities, temporary emigration and a negative behavioral response to capture in the majority of months. We found no support for variation in capture probabilities, recapture probabilities, and temporary emigration between locations. However, we found that location strongly influenced survival estimates. Specifically, survival estimates were significantly higher at the undisturbed site than at the urban site. Our results emphasize the importance of estimating capture probabilities, recapture probabilities, capture response, and temporary emigration when evaluating survival in highly secretive aquatic animals. Failure to account for these population parameters will likely yield biased estimates of survival in freshwater animal populations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Fitness benefits to individuals from using a particular habitat during the non-breeding season are likely species- and habitat-specific. Our goal was to define the postbreeding habitat use of adult Wood Frogs (Rana sylvatica) within continuous oak-hickory forest in Missouri. We used radio-telemetry to determine whether adult Wood Frogs are evenly spaced throughout this forest type or clumped at a particular resource. In addition, we determined microhabitat selection using conditional logistic regression that compares the microhabitat at frog locations to paired points located 2 m from the frog. Adult frogs migrated from breeding sites located on ridgetops into ephemeral, rocky ravines. Use of drainages by Wood Frogs depended on the distance between the breeding site and drainage, and the orientation of drainages relative to the pond edge influenced whether migratory paths of frogs are funneled or spaced apart. The most supported model of microhabitat selection indicated that frogs selected locations with increased leaf litter depth and air temperature and with decreased humidity and light compared to paired points. Persistence of Wood Frog populations along the southwestern edge of their range requires successful annual migrations between breeding sites and forested drainages, which are important nonbreeding habitat for Wood Frogs in a Missouri oak-hickory forest.},
annote = {Used radiotelemetry to estimate Wood Frog habitat use during the non-breeding season. 42 frogs were tracked daily at three different pond-upland sites. Various habitat components were measured at observation sites and paired sites adjacent to the occupied point. AIC was used for comparing 14 competing a priori models. The researchers found full support for their global model and observed frogs displaying preferences for sites with deeper leaf litter, higher air temperatures, and decreased humidity and light. Frogs generally migrated towards unique locations in drainages and remained static after reaching their destination. Wood Frogs may seek out microhabitat that optimizes hydration needs and foraging opportunities - low light and warm soil environments are preferential for digestion. This research highlights the need to maintain landscape connectivity between amphibian breeding and non-breeding sites. For Wood Frogs critical habitats include breeding wetlands and surrounding forested drainages.

The causes of these declines are a matter of continued research, but probably include climate change, land-use change and spread of the pathogenic fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Here we assess the spatial distribution and interactions of these primary threats in relation to the global distribution of amphibian species. We show that the greatest proportions of species negatively affected by climate change are projected to be found in Africa, parts of northern South America and the Andes. Regions with the highest projected impact of land-use and climate change coincide, but there is little spatial overlap with regions highly threatened by the fungal disease. Overall, the areas harbouring the richest amphibian faunas are disproportionately more affected by one or multiple threat factors than areas with low richness. Amphibian declines are likely to accelerate in the twenty-first century, because multiple drivers of extinction could jeopardize their populations more than previous, mono-causal, assessments have suggested.},

I suggest that this is a major oversight as EFS occur in various forms across the globe. In the northeastern United States, these systems, whether ephemeral (“vernal”) pools or ephemeral or intermittent headwater streams are abundant and provide unique habitats critical to the maintenance of forest biodiversity. Since the hydrology of these waterbodies is strongly affected by weather patterns (in the short-term) or climate (long-term), they are especially sensitive to climate change. In this essay, I review the literature on relationships between climate and hydrology of EFS and on relationships between hydrology and ecology of these systems. I then conclude with my assessment of potential impacts of GCC on the hydrology of EFS and implications for their ecology. The focus of this essay will be on EFS of the forests of the northeastern United States, but will include literature from other regions as they relate to the general relationships between GCC and EFS.},

abstract = {The loss of small seasonal wetlands and adjacent forested habitat is a major threat to pool-breeding amphibians in North America. Identifying environmental correlates of breeding effort (and success) in remaining intact landscapes is a critical first step in conservation planning. Little is known about how pool-breeding amphibian populations respond to fine-scale variations in hydroperiod or neighboring forest structure and composition. We studied these associations for wood frogs (Rana sylvatica LeConte, 1825) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum (Shaw, 1802)) in a forested New England landscape (southern Maine, USA). We conducted egg mass counts across two seasons at 87 strictly seasonal pools. The influence of hydroperiod and landscape (150 and 500 m scales) habitat characteristics on breeding effort were investigated. Pools with longer hydroperiods (‡18 weeks post breeding) that were relatively isolated from other breeding wetlands ({\textless}13 neighboring pools within 150 m and {\textless}19 within 500 m) supported larger breeding populations of both wood frogs and spotted salamanders. Salamander breeding populations were largest in relatively mature forests. Natural- ized, anthropogenic pools supported comparable levels of breeding effort with that of natural pools. Conservation plan- ning for wood frogs and spotted salamanders should incorporate pools at the longer end of the seasonal hydroperiod gradient.},

Longer hydroperiod, isolated pools were found to support larger breeding populations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders. Salamander populations were larger in relatively mature forests.

Longer hydroperiod, isolated pools support larger breeding populations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders

Relatively mature forests support larger salamander breeding populations

forest pool breeding species prefer closed canopy forest conditions for upland activity

Other methods:
-Egg mass counts
-Hydroperiod threshold measurements
-Canopy ovenness over pool
-Forest characteristics: forest cover, DWM, canopy cover, slope, area of rocky outcrop, and percentage of shrubs, leaf litter depth, potential spotted salamander burws

Long hydroperiod pools can be optimal in environments with drought and/or low density of predators

Pool clusters support larger regional population sizes but individual pools in a cluster host smaller pops than equivalent pools in isolated context

abstract = {Human activities over the last three centuries have significantly transformed the Earth's environment, primarily through the conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture. This study presents a simple approach to derive geographically explicit changes in global croplands from 1700 to 1992. By calibrating a remotely sensed land cover classification data set against cropland inventory data, we derived a global representation of permanent croplands in 1992, at 5 min spatial resolution [Ramankutty and Foley, 1998]. To reconstruct historical croplands, we first compile an extensive database of historical cropland inventory data, at the national and subnational level, from a variety of sources. Then we use our 1992 cropland data within a simple land cover change model, along with the historical inventory data, to reconstruct global 5 min resolution data on permanent cropland areas from 1992 back to 1700. The reconstructed changes in historical croplands are consistent with the history of human settlement and patterns of economic development. By overlaying our historical cropland data set over a newly derived potential vegetation data set, we analyze our results in terms of the extent to which different natural vegetation types have been converted for agriculture. We further examine the extent to which croplands have been abandoned in different parts of the world. Our data sets could be used within global climate models and global ecosystem models to understand the impacts of land cover change on climate and on the cycling of carbon and water. Such an analysis is a crucial aid to sharpen our thinking about a sustainable future.},

annote = {An argument for using plethodontids as indicator organisms of forest health. Because plethodontids are highly abundant, cheap to sample, highly interactive across food webs and trophic levels, and highly sensitive to stressors, they are useful surrogates for ecosystem integrity, particularly of North American forest ecosystems. They are heavily impacted by multiple abiotic (leaf litter, soil characteristics, light, temperature, etc.) and biotic (prey and predators) variables in forest systems. They respond both to large scale habitat changes and small scale modifications to microhabitats where they reside. Most importantly, the authors argue that because variation in plethodontid counts across time (CV) are relatively lower than that of frogs, mole salamanders, birds, small mammals, and various insects, there is much greater statistical power to make robust population estimates and strong inferences about the status of forest ecosystems. Finally, the threatened and endangered status of many salamander species underlines the rationale for monitoring these organisms as representatives of larger biodiversity crises.

Plethodontid salamanders are beneficial surrogates for monitoring forest health:

- numerous
- cheap to sample
- highly interactive with various trophic levels
- very sensitive to stressors

Leaf litter is the most critical habitat for plethodontids, because it is a location of feeding and mating

Forest stage affects microclimate characteristics (light, moisture, temperature) which can influence salamander populations

Welsh and Lind (1991) found various significant relationships between abundances and stem densities (of small and large trees)

Variation in counts of plethodontid salamanders (27{\%}) is lower than the CV for frogs (46{\%}) and mole salamanders (37{\%}) - making them more suitable to assumptions of replicability across studies - high power to determine relative abundance (or other trends over time) across plots},

Understanding how these methods arose, spread, and were argued over since then illuminates how p?{\textless}?0.05 came to be a standard for scientific inference, the advantage it offered at the time, and how it was interpreted. This historical perspective can inform the work of statisticians today by encouraging thoughtful consideration of how their work, including proposed alternatives to the p-value, will be perceived and used by scientists. And it can engage students more fully and encourage critical thinking rather than rote applications of formulae.

abstract = {The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling.Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems.The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues.This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

This communication reports a specialized nest building behaviour of an Indian treefrog Rhacophorus lateralis, which was observed in natural habitat at Kalpetta in Wayanad District, Kerala. This behaviour of leaf folding is the first report in the family Rhacophoridae, and in the Asiatic amphibians. Nesting behaviour of R. lateralis is unique among Rhacophorus - a purse-like nest is made over water by folding a single leaf around the egg mass (embryos and translucent foam) by the female alone after oviposition. The function of this parental investment is to prevent desiccation of eggs in open sunlight. This paper also documents the multiple leaf nesting behaviour of other two species of this genus, R. calcadensis and R. pseudomalabaricus, and the previously documented nesting behaviour of R. malabaricus using more than one leaf.},

abstract = {Aim: The United States (US) and other affluent countries consume vast quantities of global natural resources, but contribute proportionately less to the extraction of many raw materials. This imbalance is due, in part, to domestic policies intended to protect the environment. Ironically, developed nations are often better equipped to extract resources in an environmentally prudent manner than the major suppliers. Thus, although citizens of affluent countries may imagine that preservationist domestic policies are conserving resources and protecting nature, heavy consumption rates necessitate resource extraction elsewhere and oftentimes under weak environmental oversight. A major consequence of this 'illusion of natural resource preservation' is greater global environmental degradation than would arise if consumption were reduced and a large portion of production was shared by affluent countries. This paper considers some implications of the consumption, management and conservation of forests and wood at a local and global scale. Location: We focus on Massachusetts, the eighth most forested state in the USA (by area), the third most densely populated, and an affluent region with consumption rates that are among the highest in the country. Methods: Estimates of wood production and consumption are generated, and comparisons are made with other commonly used materials (e.g. steel, concrete, aluminium). Results: A comparison of the feasibility and environmental impact of various strategies for dealing with rising wood demand suggests that the US should strive to: (1) reduce per capita consumption of wood and its substitutes, (2) recycle forest products more effectively, (3) protect extensive areas of intensively managed and unmanaged forests and (4) promote sound forest management where the environmental consequences are mild. Forestry and the sustainable generation of wood in Massachusetts would allow preservation of primary forests elsewhere in the world. Main conclusions: When aggressive reductions in wood consumption and effective recycling are combined with judiciously increased harvest levels, 50{\%} of the Massachusetts's wood consumption could be met at sustainable rates, even while preserving large undisturbed blocks of forest.},

abstract = {Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal popu- lations to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abun- dance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.},

abstract = {* 1Changes in the areas of croplands and pastures, and rates of wood harvest in seven regions of the United States, including Alaska, were derived from historical statistics for the period 1700–1990. These rates of land-use change were used in a cohort model, together with equations defining the changes in live vegetation, slash, wood products and soil that follow a change in land use, to calculate the annual flux of carbon to the atmosphere from changes in land use. * 2The calculated flux increased from less than 10 TgC/yr in 1700 to a maximum of about 400 TgC/yr around 1880 and then decreased to approximately zero by 1950. The total flux for the 290-year period was a release of 32.6 PgC. The area of forests and woodlands declined by 42{\%} (160 × 106 ha), releasing 29 PgC, or 90{\%} of the total flux. Cultivation of soils accounted for about 25{\%} of the carbon loss. Between 1950 and 1990 the annual flux of carbon was approximately zero, although eastern forests were accumulating carbon. * 3When the effects of fire and fire exclusion (reported in a companion paper) were added to this analysis of land-use change, the uptake of carbon calculated for forests was similar in magnitude to the uptake measured in forest inventories, suggesting that past harvests account for a significant fraction of the observed carbon sink in forests. * 4Changes in the management of croplands between 1965 and 1990 may have led to an additional accumulation of carbon, not included in the 32.6 PgC release, but even with this additional non-forest sink, the calculated accumulation of carbon in the United States was an order of magnitude smaller than the North American carbon sink inferred recently from atmospheric data and models.},

abstract = {Land managers rely on visitation data to inform policy and management decisions. However, visitation data is often costly and burdensome to obtain, and provides a limited depth of information. In this paper, we assess the validity of using crowd-sourced, online photographs to infer information about the habits and preferences of recreational visitors by comparing empirical data from the National Park Service to photograph data from the online platform Flickr for 38 National Parks in the western United States. Using multiple regression analysis, we find that the number of photos posted monthly in a park can reliably indicate the number of visitors to a park in a given month. Through additional statistical testing we also find that the home locations of photo-takers, provided voluntarily on an online profile, accurately show the home origins of park visitors. Together, these findings validate a new method for measuring recreational visitation, opening an opportunity for land managers worldwide to track and understand visitation by augmenting current data collection methods with crowd-sourced, online data that is easy and inexpensive to obtain. In addition, it enables future research on how visitation rates change with changes in access, management or infrastructure, weather events, or ecosystem health, and facilitates valuation research, such as travel cost studies.},

abstract = {The two most fundamental levels of biodiversity, species diversity and genetic diversity, are seldom studied simultaneously despite a strikingly similar set of processes that underlie patterns at the two levels. Agricultural land use drastically reduces populations of forest herbs in the north-temperate zone, so that bottlenecks or founder events in forests on abandoned agricultural land (i.e., secondary forests) may have a longterm impact on both species diversity and genetic diversity. Using forest-herb community surveys and molecular-genetic analysis of populations of Trillium grandiflorum, a representative species of forest herb, I investigated the influence of land-use history, landscape context, and environmental conditions on diversity and divergence at the population and community levels. Secondary forests (70-100 years old) had reduced diversity of both genes and species relative to primary forests (i.e., stands never cleared for agriculture). The community in secondary forests had an overrepresentation of the most common species in the landscape, though divergence in species' relative abundances within stands suggested an influence of community drift via local bottlenecks. Secondary-forest populations of T. grandiflorum were more genetically divergent than those in primary forests, again indicating drift in small populations. Land-use history and the size of populations and communities drove correlations between species diversity and genetic diversity (and community divergence X genetic divergence), though the strength of correlations was relatively weak. These results extend the generality of positive species-genetic diversity correlations previously observed for islands, and they demonstrate a long-term legacy of land-use history at multiple levels of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Community dynamics in temporary waters are constrained by the hydroregime (depth, timing, duration, frequency, and predictability of water in an aquatic habitat), which in turn is influenced by climatic patterns and anthropogenic use of water in the landscape. Declining rainfall in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as southwestern Australia, has decreased the depth and duration of water in temporary wetlands, potentially altering the composition of invertebrate communities. We used a long-term data set (6–25 y) to examine temporal changes in hydroregimes and aquatic invertebrate diversity (based on species presence/absence) at 9 seasonal wetlands. The study wetlands maintained distinctly seasonal hydroregimes, despite declining rainfall and the contraction of wetland hydroperiods. Distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) indicated that conductivity, NO3−+NO2−, and turbidity were the most important factors explaining the changes in invertebrate community composition over time. Allocation of species into 4 trait-based groups based on their resilience to or resistance of drought and their mode of recolonization of a water body upon rewetting revealed that the fauna is dominated by active dispersers. This result suggests that the proximity of source wetlands from which mobile invertebrate species and vertebrate vectors, such as waterbirds, can recolonize seasonal wetlands is an important factor influencing the invertebrate community response to rewetting. Despite the decline in water availability, we found little evidence of a shift to a more arid-adapted fauna. We suggest that the maintenance of a mosaic of wetlands of varying hydroregimes at the whole-landscape scale will be critical to the future persistence of aquatic invertebrate communities in Mediterranean regions where the frequency and intensity of droughts is predicted to increase.},

abstract = {This study treats dead trees and their remnants in the managed and virgin forest of Rajhenavski Rog, Slovenia, at a location of Omphalodo-Fagetum omphalodetosum plant community. The study plots were selected in four forest cycle developmental phases (optimal, mixed, regeneration and juvenile phase) of both managed and virgin forest. The quantity (volume and dry matter) and the structure of coarse woody debris (CWD) were compared between the selected plots within the particular type of the forest, and between the virgin and the managed forest. Belowground CWD was quantified by modeling the tree's biomass and decaying processes of the trees. The results show significant differences in CWD between the virgin forest developmental phases. The highest concentration of CWD in the virgin forest was found in the regeneration phase (626.0 m3/ha and 179.3 tdry matter/ha), while the juvenile phase (248.3 m3/ha and 40.2 tdry matter/ha) has the smallest amount of CWD. Managed forest has very evenly distribution of CWD between developmental phases and it ranges from 41.0 m3/ha and 49.0 tdry matter/ha in the mixed developmental phase to 67.0 m3/ha and 56.2 tdry matter/ha in the juvenile phase. The main reasons for such a large differences are forest management measures (e.g. wood extraction, short rotation time, reduction of natural tree mortality), which decrease quantity, distribution and size of CWD. It was identified that forest management causes reduction and homogenization of CWD on our study plots, which can trigger degradation processes (e.g. soil erosion, reduction of site productivity, reduction of habitats). Tree heights curves show significant differences in maximum tree's height between the virgin and the managed forest. Maximum tree's height is lower in the managed forest which may indicate the reduction of forest productivity due to reduction of CWD. Study has shown some positive effects of forest management on accumulation of underground CWD in the managed forest (from 40.0 tdry matter/ha to 48.2 tdry matter/ha), which significantly exceeds underground CWD in the virgin forest (from 2.0 tdry matter/ha to 22.8 tdry matter/ha). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In stark contrast to the amplified warming observed throughout much of the Arctic, the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of subarctic Canada has maintained cool temperatures, largely due to the counteracting effects of persistent sea ice. However, since the mid-1990s, climate of the HBL has passed a tipping point, the pace and magnitude of which is exceptional even by Arctic standards, exceeding the range of regional long-term variability. Using high-resolution, palaeolimnological records of algal remains in dated lake sediment cores, we report that, within this short period of intense warming, striking biological changes have occurred in the region's freshwater ecosystems. The delayed and intense warming in this remote region provides a natural observatory for testing ecosystem resilience under a rapidly changing climate, in the absence of direct anthropogenic influences. The environmental repercussions of this climate change are of global significance, influencing the huge store of carbon in the region's extensive peatlands, the world's southern-most polar bear population that depends upon Hudson Bay sea ice and permafrost for survival, and native communities who rely on this landscape for sustenance.},

abstract = {Ambient concentrations of eight predominantly anthropogenic halocarbons were measured via in situ gas chromatography in California's South Coast air basin for both summer and fall during the 2005 Study of Organic Aerosols at Riverside (SOAR). Ongoing emissions of the banned halocarbons methylchloroform and CFC-11 were observed in the South Coast air basin, whereas CFC-113 emissions have effectively ceased. We estimate anthropogenic emissions in the South Coast air basin for methylchloroform, CFC-11, HCFC-141b, chloroform, tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and dichloromethane based on regressions of halocarbon to carbon monoxide mixing ratios and carbon monoxide emission inventories. We estimate per capita methylchloroform and chloroform emissions in the South Coast air basin for the year 2005 to be 6.6 +/- 0.4 g/(person.year) and 19 +/- 1 g/(person.year), respectively. We compare our results to national emission estimates calculated from previous work; for several compounds, emissions in the South Coast air basin are significantly lower than national per capita emissions. We observed strong seasonal differences in anthropogenic emissions of methylchloroform and chloroform; emissions were 4.5 and 2.5 times greater in summer than in fall, respectively. Possible seasonal sources include landfills and water chlorination. We conclude that seasonal variability in methylchloroform emissions has not been included in previous inventories and may cause errors in methylchloroform emission estimates after the year 2000 and seasonally resolved inversion calculations of hydroxyl radical abundance.},

A major component of road runoff in northern countries is salt (mostly NaCl) used as a winter de-icing agent, but few studies of effects of road salts on aquatic organisms exist. Amphibians require aquatic habitats and chemical pollution is implicated as a major factor in global population declines. We exposed wood frog tadpoles to NaCl. Tests revealed 96-h LC50 values of 2636 and 5109 mg/l and tadpoles experienced reduced activity, weight, and displayed physical abnormalities. A 90 d chronic experiment revealed significantly lower survivorship, decreased time to metamorphosis, reduced weight and activity, and increased physical abnormalities with increasing salt concentration (0.00, 0.39, 77.50, 1030.00 mg/l).

abstract = {Representation of women in science drops substantially at each career stage, from early student to senior investigator. Disparities in opportunities for women to contribute to research metrics, such as distinguished speaker events and authorship, have been reported in many fields in the U.S.A. and Europe. However, whether female representation in scientific contributions differs in other regions, such as Latin America, is not well understood. In this study, in order to determine whether female authorship is influenced by gender or institutional location of the last (senior) author or by subfield within ecology, we gathered author information from 6849 articles in ten ecological and zoological journals that publish research articles either in or out of Latin America. We found that female authorship has risen marginally since 2002 (27 to 31{\%}), and varies among Latin American countries, but not between Latin America and other regions. Last author gender predicted female co-authorship across all journals and regions, as research groups led by women published with over 60{\%} female co-authors whereas those led by men published with less than 20{\%} female co-authors. Our findings suggest that implicit biases and stereotype threats that women face in male-led laboratories could be sources of female withdrawal and leaky pipelines in ecology and zoology. Accordingly, we encourage every PI to self-evaluate their lifetime percentage of female co-authors. Female role models and cultural shifts–especially by male senior authors–are crucial for female retention and unbiased participation in science.},

RMF are a species-rich north-eastern variant of the Mixed Mesophytic Forest Type$\backslash$nof eastern North America.$\backslash$nMethods Land-use history patterns were reconstructed for two towns (c. 16,000 ha)$\backslash$nfrom the onset of widespread European settlement and agricultural land-use in the$\backslash$nlate eighteenth century until present. Vegetation and a range of environmental vari-$\backslash$nables were sampled in sixty-one 10 {\textperiodcentered} 10 m plots in thirty-four forest stands with$\backslash$nvarying histories of human disturbance. Vegetation data were ordinated (DCA) to$\backslash$nidentify patterns of variation and related environmental and historical factors. The$\backslash$ndistribution patterns of individual taxa in relation to historical land-use and envi-$\backslash$nronmental factors were analysed using G-tests of independence and logistic regres-$\backslash$nsion. Associations between species secondary forest colonization ability and life$\backslash$nhistory characteristics (e.g. diaspore dispersal mode, degree of vegetative spread) were$\backslash$nassessed.$\backslash$nResults Persistent compositional differences were documented between the veget-$\backslash$nation of primary forests and post-agricultural, secondary forests indicating that dis-$\backslash$ntribution patterns for many plant species still reﬂect the open, agricultural$\backslash$nenvironment of the nineteenth century, despite the current predominance of forest$\backslash$ncover in the study area. A major factor driving modern vegetation patterns in RMF$\backslash$nis the ability and rate of colonization by forest herbs. In particular, species with$\backslash$nseeds lacking morphological adaptations for dispersal (barochores) and those which$\backslash$nproduce seeds with elaiosomes to encourage ant dispersal (myrmecochores) are less$\backslash$nfrequent in secondary forests. Environmental differences between primary and sec-$\backslash$nondary forests, although present, appear to be less important in inﬂuencing species$\backslash$ndistribution patterns.$\backslash$nMain conclusions Widespread agricultural land-use represents a novel disturbance in$\backslash$nthe naturally forested ecosystems of eastern North America with long-term impacts on$\backslash$nplant community composition and structure. Many secondary forest sites that are en-$\backslash$nvironmentally suitable for RMF vegetation do not support the suite of plant species$\backslash$ntypical of this community type, apparently because of the dispersal limitations of certain$\backslash$nforest herbs. These poorly dispersed herb taxa are well adapted for growth in stable$\backslash$nforest ecosystems characterized by local, small-scale disturbance (e.g. gap-phase dy-$\backslash$nnamics), yet are maladapted for rapid population recovery and recolonization following$\backslash$nsevere disturbance (e.g. agricultural land-use).},

These stations are classified into rural, small city, medium city, large city, and metropolis based on the updated information of total population and specific station locations. The significance of urban warming effects on regional average temperature trends is estimated using monthly mean temperature series of the station group datasets, which undergo inhomogeneity adjustment. The authors found that the largest effect of urbanization on annual mean surface air temperature trends occurs for the large-city station group, with the urban warming being 0.16{\&}{\#}176;C (10 yr){\&}{\#}8722;1, and the effect is the smallest for the small-city station group with urban warming being only 0.07{\&}{\#}176;C (10 yr){\&}{\#}8722;1. A similar assessment is made for the dataset of national basic/reference stations, which has been widely used in regional climate change analyses in China. The results indicate that the regional average annual mean temperature series, as calculated using the data from the national basic/reference stations, is significantly impacted by urban warming, and the trend of urban warming is estimated to be 0.11{\&}{\#}176;C (10 yr){\&}{\#}8722;1. The contribution of urban warming to total annual mean surface air temperature change as estimated with the national basic/reference station dataset reaches 37.9{\&}{\#}37;. It is therefore obvious that, in the current regional average surface air temperature series in north China, or probably in the country as a whole, there still remain large effects from urban warming. The urban warming bias for the regional average temperature anomaly series is corrected. After that, the increasing rate of the regional annual mean temperature is brought down from 0.29{\&}{\#}176;C (10 yr){\&}{\#}8722;1 to 0.18{\&}{\#}176;C (10 yr){\&}{\#}8722;1, and the total change in temperature approaches 0.72{\&}{\#}176;C for the period analyzed.},

abstract = {Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) in the world. As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969–2013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t = 2.884, p = 0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra's vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.},

abstract = {Efforts to address a reproducibility crisis have generated several valid proposals for improving the quality of scientific research. We argue there is also need to address the separate but related issues of relevance and responsiveness. To address relevance, researchers must produce what decision makers actually need to inform investments and public policy-that is, the probability that a claim is true or the probability distribution of an effect size given the data. The term responsiveness refers to the irregularity and delay in which issues about the quality of research are brought to light. Instead of relying on the good fortune that some motivated researchers will periodically conduct efforts to reveal potential shortcomings of published research, we could establish a continuous quality-control process for scientific research itself. Quality metrics could be designed through the application of this statistical process control for the research enterprise. We argue that one quality control metric-the probability that a research hypothesis is true-is required to address at least relevance and may also be part of the solution for improving responsiveness and reproducibility. This article proposes a "straw man"solution which could be the basis of implementing these improvements. As part of this solution, we propose one way to "bootstrap" priors. The processes required for improving reproducibility and relevance can also be part of a comprehensive statistical quality control for science itself by making continuously monitored metrics about the scientific performance of a field of research.

abstract = {Fire alters the abundance and diversity of many species, but its effects on amphibians are poorly known. We tested whether prescribed fire burning affected amphibian abundance and diversity within the Francis Marion National Forest, South Carolina, by monitoring assemblages at 15 temporary ponds with five different burn histories: 0, 1, 3, 5, and 12 years after burns. We also monitored terrestrial ad aquatic environmental variables likely to influence amphibian diversity, such as leaf-litter depth, pond water chemistry, and distance to neighboring ponds. Fire had significant negative effects. Immediate effects (burning during the study) explained 12.8{\%} and 10.8{\%} of the variation in anuran and amphibian specis abundance, respectively, whereas short-term effects explained 31.8{\%} and 24.6{\%} of variation in amphibian species richness and evenness, respectively. Species richness increased and evenness decreased with time since burn, primarily because salamanders were rarely encountered at sites burned within 2 years. These sites had the shallowest leaf litter and highest soil temperature variances. Environmental factors unrelated to burning also significantly influenced amphibian diversity. Water chemistry explained 31.1{\%} of variation in species richness, 32.2{\%} of evenness, and {\textgreater}25{\%} of anuran, salamander, and total amphibian abundances. Salamanders were most sensitive to water chemistry factors, particularly pH. Our results suggest that decreasing frequency of prescribed burns from the current 2-3 years to 3-7 years will better maintain diverse amphibian and plant assemblages. Substituting growing-season burns for the current practice of winter and spring burns would avoid repeatedly interrupting amphibian breeding and would maintain the desired longleaf pine community.},

Richness increasess and evenness decreases with TSF. Fire affects aquatic stages of amphibians by adding nutrients to the system (can stimulate plankton and algae growth; helpful for juveniles) and raising the pH of the water and soil (helpful for acid-sensitive species). 

Many sampling methods: drift fences, PVC refugia, calling censuses, minnow traps, and visual encounter surveys. The study assumed little recapture, and thus did not mark individuals. 

25 species, most common were Pseudacris ocularis, Lithobates sphenocephalus, and Anaxyrus terrestris. Burning did not afect aquatic environmental factors. 

Advocated a 3-5 year burn cycle in this particular biological community. Probably best to have variable burn seasons in a mosaic model.},

Model selection can also be used to compare mechanistic models derived from ecological theory, thereby providing a formal framework for testing the theory. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is the most commonly adopted criterion used to compare models; however, its performance in general is not very well known. The best model according to AIC has the smallest expected Kullback-Leibler (K-L) distance, which is an information-theoretic measure of the difference between a model and the truth. I review the theory behind AIC and demonstrate how it can be used to test ecological theory by considering two example studies of foraging, motivated by simple foraging theory. I present plausible truths for the two studies, and models that can be fit to the foraging data. K-L distances are calculated for simulated studies, which provide an appropriate test of AIC. Results support the use of a commonly adopted rule of thumb for selecting models based on AIC differences. However, AICc, a corrected version of AIC commonly used to reduce model selection bias, showed no clear improvement, and model averaging, a technique to reduce model prediction bias, gave mixed results.},

Terrestrial detritus is expected to have the greatest impact on food webs when water bodies are small and shallow with low levels of incident light. Temporary forested ponds fit this description and are often assumed to have a leaf detritus-based food web, but this has not been quantified. In a whole-ecosystem experiment, we traced the flow of isotopically enriched leaf litter to primary producers and consumers in a small, forested pond. We found that terrestrial leaves provided nutrients to algae, offering an indirect pathway in which leaf litter can enter the food web. Terrestrial leaves were also consumed directly, and larval caddisfly (Limnephilus sp.) shredders likely mobilized leaf nutrients to other consumers, a process overlooked in many previous small-scale experiments that did not incorporate shredders. Unexpectedly, most consumers relied heavily upon algal food pathways despite low light and net heterotrophic conditions. Overall, our study highlights the interconnectedness of algal and leaf litter pathways in small pond food webs, and emphasizes that algal pathways are prevalent and important even in small, shaded ponds with high loads of terrestrial leaf litter.},

abstract = {Historical forest clearance and agriculture have had profound effects on the landscape of the southeastern United States. This study examines a site called Monument Hill located in the eastern foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in central Virginia in order to better understand the long-term effects of historical agriculture on soil and streams. This site, deeply gullied and drained by an incised first-order stream, was first settled in the mid-eighteenth century and became part of a large nineteenth-century plantation. A thick sediment fan at the base of the hill buried and preserved a historical soil surface, archaeological artifacts, and woody debris datable by dendrochronology. The geomorphology of the site, along with limited historical data and tree ages from the mature second-growth forest cover, has enabled reconstruction of the sequence of land-use changes and measurement of geomorphic response over two and a half centuries. The original forest at the site was cleared between 1767 and circa 1800, probably to grow tobacco followed by wheat or corn. Soil erosion and depletion resulted in land abandonment and gullying. Forest regrowth began circa 1831, with tree establishment occurring rapidly in the 1860s and 1870s and peaking around 1888. A volume of 33,700 m3of sediment was removed from the gullies at an average rate of approximately 130 tons/ha/year during the disturbance and reforestation period. Only about 40{\%} of this gully material is present in the sediment fan at the bottom of the hill, so the rest must have been transported downstream as bed and suspended load. The small stream in the valley was inundated with sediment and aggraded. After the sharp decrease in sediment supply that accompanied reforestation, the stream incised deeply into its alluvial deposits at rates up to 90 mm/year during the late nineteenth century. The study site is typical of many first-order drainages found throughout the region but experienced its peak erosive land use relatively early (by circa 1830) compared to areas further south and west. Minor stream adjustment continues to occur at this site. It is therefore likely that low-order streams in other parts of the Southern Piedmont and Appalachian regions that experienced a more recent peak in erosive agricultural land use will continue to adjust their channel morphology for decades. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Using an ocean general circulation model of the tropical Pacific Ocean, it has been found that inclusion of the Gal?lagos leads to improvements in the sea surface temperature (SST) field. Obstruction of the equatorial undercurrent (EUC) by the Gal?pagos is critical to the improved SST, ultimately leading to a more diffuse thermocline, reduced entrainment mixing and reduced transport in the meridional-vertical cells. The pattern of SST warming due to the inclusion of the Gal?pagos is similar to that of the known cold bias in current ocean models and the NOAAA CFS. Such an improvement in SST would have a positive impact on the ability of coupled models to produce realistic clouds, precipitation, biological activity and carbon cycling.},

Adult winter densities within forest habitat {\textless}100 m from the breeding pond were low for all species (range 0.1–1.9 individuals / 100 m2, n = 6 enclosures). During our 2-year study, at least 40{\%} of wood frogs, 52{\%} of blue-spotted salamanders, and 60{\%} of spotted salamanders wintered {\textgreater}100 m from the breeding pond. Males tended to winter closer to the breeding pond than did females. Adult wood frogs and eastern newts were largely absent from upland forest adjacent to the breeding pond during spring and summer, but they entered these areas in significant numbers to winter. Analyses of net flow of amphibians resulting from fall movement suggest that summer and winter densities of Ambystoma salamanders remained similar, while there were large increases in wood frog and eastern newt densities within terrestrial habitats near the breeding pond during fall. These results support a growing body of evidence that maintenance of suitable terrestrial habitat beyond 100 m from breeding pools is important for maintaining pool-breeding amphibian populations. Narrow protected buffer strips around breeding ponds might be even less effective than previously thought due to the disproportionate representation of males within these areas.},

abstract = {Impacts of forest management practices on amphibian populations have received growing attention in the last 10 yr. However, to date, measured responses include only comparisons of species diversity indices and population counts without true spatial and temporal controls. We used an experimental approach to test for differences in growth rate, fecundity, age at maturity, and whole-body storage lipids in individual mole salamanders, Ambystoma talpoideum, placed in differently managed habitats. Four 100-m2 field enclosures were built in each of two habitats, a 4-mo-old clearcut and an adjacent 40-yr-old pine forest. On 19 July 1994, 80 recently metamorphosed and individually marked, weighed, and measured (snout?vent length) A. talpoideum were randomly assigned to field enclosures (n = 640 salamanders). Between 31 October 1994 and 31 March 1995, salamanders were collected from the enclosures using pitfall traps. Body mass and length, whole-body nonpolar storage lipids, clutch size, and egg nonpolar lipids were determined for sexually mature salamanders. After an average of 5?6 mo exposure to clearcut and 40-yr-old pine forest, there were no significant differences between habitats for number of recaptured salamanders, final body mass, final body length, percent whole-body storage lipid, clutch size, or percent storage lipid of eggs. Our results suggest, in contrast to expectations based on many comparative studies with other species, that habitat modification resulting from clearcutting may not have detrimental effects on newly metamorphosed A. talpoideum. We contrast our experimental approach, with its strengths and weaknesses, to previous comparative studies and identify the inherent complexities involved in establishing a causal link between habitat management (clearcutting) and effects on amphibians.},

Amphibians were not exposed to the treatments themselves, which probabably induces some mortality on local populations. Downed woody debris was left on the forest floor as was leaf litter.

abstract = {Population regulation in pond-breeding amphibians has generally been assumed to occur through density dependence in the aquatic larval stage. However, studies examining terrestrial stage population dynamics are comparatively rare. As a consequence, the relative importance of density dependence in the terrestrial stage remains largely unknown. Here I determine the density dependence of terrestrial stage vital rates, including juvenile and adult survival, age and size at first reproduction, and reproductive traits, for a population of Wood Frogs, Rana sylvatica, in Michigan. I also examine the carry-over effects of density-dependent variation in metamorphic traits on adult demographic traits. During the 21 years of this study, the number of breeding adult males and females varied by an order of magnitude, whereas the number of metamorphic juveniles leaving the pond varied by two orders of magnitude. Adult male and female annual survival was negatively correlated with the number of males and females, respectively. Partial correlation coefficients (holding population size of the opposite sex, number of juveniles, and precipitation levels constant) indicated that variation in adult male and female survival was largely explained by variation in the number of males and females, respectively. Juvenile survival (both males and females) was strongly negatively correlated with juvenile population size but not juvenile body size, adult population size, or total precipitation. Partial correlations revealed that variation in juvenile population size was the single most important factor accounting for variation in male and female juvenile survival, and female age and size at first reproduction. Clutch size and egg size also varied with juvenile population size independent of female body size. At lower juvenile population sizes, female juveniles matured earlier, at a larger body size, and produced larger numbers of smaller eggs than at high juvenile population sizes. Although juvenile body size was positively correlated with male and female reproductive body size and total clutch weight, juvenile fitness traits, in general, were more closely related to variation in juvenile population sizes. Larval traits did not affect adult fitness traits in the terrestrial stage. A nonlinear logistic model best described the functional relationship between juvenile population size and the number of surviving males, females, and total adult biomass. As number of juveniles produced increased, the number of surviving adult males, females, and total biomass plateaued, suggesting that the terrestrial environment limited adult population size. My results demonstrate that density-dependent effects operating in the terrestrial stage may be important in regulating Wood Frog population size.},
annote = {A primary example of longitudinal amphibian field research on population dynamics of species with complex life cycles. Berven, over 21 years of marking and recapture wood frogs at a single forested site, demonstrated that terrestrial processes are instrumental to population fluctuation. Density dependence (i.e., juvenile and adult population size) had limiting effects on reproductive traits such as maturation and clutch size, larval and adult growth and survival rates, and overal population size. Larval performance traits (e.g,. time to metamorphosis, size of metamorphs) did not affect juvenile survival in the terrestrial stage, in contrast to previous research. Berven recommends a combination of field studies and controlled experiments to understand the complex biotic and abiotic variables that govern these multistage dynamics.

This "site-selection bias" has been mentioned in the literature but is not well known. We show using simulated and real population data that when site-selection biases are introduced, they have substantial impact on inferences about population trends. We use a left-censoring method to show patterns consistent with the operation of the site-selection bias in real population studies. The site-selection bias is, thus, an important consideration for conservation biologists, and we offer suggestions for minimizing or mitigating it in study design and analysis.},

abstract = {When the editors of Basic and Applied Social Psychology effectively banned the use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) from articles published in their journal, it set off a fire-storm of discussions both supporting the decision and defending the utility of NHST in scientific research. At the heart of NHST is the p-value which is the probability of obtaining an effect equal to or more extreme than the one observed in the sample data, given the null hypothesis and other model assumptions. Although this is conceptually different from the probability of the null hypothesis being true, given the sample, p-values nonetheless can provide evidential information, toward making an inference about a parameter. Applying a 10,000-case simulation described in this article, the authors found that p-values' inferential signals to either reject or not reject a null hypothesis about the mean ($\alpha$ = 0.05) were consistent for almost 70{\%} of the cases with the parameter's true location for the sampled-from population. Success increases if a hybrid decision criterion, minimum effect size plus p-value (MESP), is used. Here, rejecting the null also requires the difference of the observed statistic from the exact null to be meaningfully large or practically significant, in the researcher's judgment and experience. The simulation compares performances of several methods: from p-value and/or effect size-based, to confidence-interval based, under various conditions of true location of the mean, test power, and comparative sizes of the meaningful distance and population variability. For any inference procedure that outputs a binary indicator, like flagging whether a p-value is significant, the output of one single experiment is not sufficient evidence for a definitive conclusion. Yet, if a tool like MESP generates a relatively reliable signal and is used knowledgeably as part of a research process, it can provide useful information. ARTICLE HISTORY},

This is partly due to a lack of information regarding the relationship between ecological succession, plant community composition, microhabitat and salamander abundance. Three sampling transects consisting of drift fence arrays, vegetation assessments and microhabitat surveys were extended 100 m into the terrestrial habitat surrounding a seasonal wetland at Beech Fork State Park inWayne County, West Virginia. Principal components analysis was used to identify habitat gradients. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to develop predictive models for Marbled Salamander abundance using raw data and principal components. Models predicted much of the variation in my data set r2 = .9974, .8804 for raw data and principal components respectively.

This method can be extended, given multiple survey periods, to permit the estimation of seasonal probabilities of $\psi$, colonization ($\gamma$), persistence ($\phi$), and extinction (1 − $\phi$) in season t. We evaluated the sampling properties of estimators of these parameters using simulated data across a range of the parameters, differing levels of sites and visits, with a published dynamic occupancy model (Royle and Kery 2007). Bias depended largely on p and the number of visits, but also on the number of sites, $\psi$t, $\gamma$, and 1 − $\phi$. To decrease bias in all parameters to near zero, our results suggest that the number of required visits will depend on p, such that the probability of detection at an occupied site is near 0.9, and the required number of sites will be near 60 for $\psi$t estimation and 120 or greater for $\gamma$ and 1 − $\phi$ estimation.

abstract = {Despite continued forest conversion and degradation, forest cover is increasing in countries across the globe. New forests are regenerating on former agricultural land, and forest plantations are being established for commercial and restoration purposes. Plantations and restored forests can improve ecosystem services and enhance biodiversity conservation, but will not match the composition and structure of the original forest cover. Approaches to restoring forest ecosystems depend strongly on levels of forest and soil degradation, residual vegetation, and desired restoration outcomes. Opportunities abound to combine ambitious forest restoration and regeneration goals with sustainable rural livelihoods and community participation. New forests will require adaptive management as dynamic, resilient systems that can withstand stresses of climate change, habitat fragmentation, and other anthropogenic effects.},

abstract = {Terrestrial habitats surrounding wetlands are critical to the management of natural resources. Al- though the protection of water resources from human activities such as agriculture, silviculture, and urban development is obvious, it is also apparent that terrestrial areas surrounding wetlands are core habitats for many semiaquatic species that depend on mesic ecotones to complete their life cycle. For purposes of conser- vation and management, it is important to define core habitats used by local breeding populations surround- ing wetlands. Our objective was to provide an estimate of the biologically relevant size of core habitats sur- rounding wetlands for amphibians and reptiles. We summarize data from the literature on the use of terrestrial habitats by amphibians and reptiles associated with wetlands (19 frog and 13 salamander species representing 1363 individuals; 5 snake and 28 turtle species representing more than 2245 individuals). Core terrestrial habitat ranged from 159 to 290 m for amphibians and from 127 to 289 m for reptiles from the edge of the aquatic site. Data from these studies also indicated the importance of terrestrial habitats for feed- ing, overwintering, and nesting, and, thus, the biological interdependence between aquatic and terrestrial habitats that is essential for the persistence of populations. The minimum and maximum values for core hab- itats, depending on the level of protection needed, can be used to set biologically meaningful buffers for wet- land and riparian habitats. These results indicate that large areas of terrestrial habitat surrounding wetlands are critical for maintaining biodiversity.},

Criteria for publication are based exclusively on the substantive importance of the research question addressed in the study, conveyed in the Introduction section of the manuscript, and the quality of the methodology, as reported in the Methods section. Practically, this policy is implemented by a two stage process whereby the editor initially distributes only the Introduction and Methods sections of a submitted manuscript to reviewers and a provisional decision regarding acceptance is made, followed by a second stage in which the complete manuscript is distributed for review but only if the decision of the first stage is for acceptance. The present paper expands upon this recommendation by addressing implications of this proposed policy with respect to statistical consultation and collaboration in research. It is suggested that under RBME, statisticians will become more integrated into research endeavors and called upon sooner for their input.},

abstract = {Coarse woody debris (CWD) has become recognised as an important component of the carbon (C) pool in forest ecosystems. In Ireland, managed Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carr.) forests account for 52.3{\%} of the total forest estate. To determine the stock and decay dynamics of above and belowground CWD, field surveys using fixed area sample plots, were conducted in six even-aged Sitka spruce stands, representing the young, intermediate and mature stages of a typical commercial rotation. The volume, mass, density loss and C:N ratio of all CWD types (logs, stumps, and coarse roots) were determined using a five-decay class (DC) system. The decay rates and half life of CWD was also determined. To estimate CWD coarse root mass; roots associated with stumps classified in different decay classes were excavated. The coarse roots were categorised into small (2-10. mm), medium (10-50. mm) and large ({\textgreater}50. mm) diameter classes.CWD C-mass ranged from 6.98 to 18.62Mgha-1and was highest in an intermediate forest (D35), while the aboveground volume varied from 6.31 to 42.27m3ha-1. Coarse roots accounted for 21{\%} to 85{\%} of the total CWD C-pool in the surveyed stands. The total CWD C-mass was poorly correlated with the number of thinning events (R2=0.29), when data from D35 was excluded. The density loss was significant in logs (45{\%}), stumps (58{\%}), and small- (38{\%}), medium- (50{\%}) and large roots (38{\%}) as decay progress from DC 0 to 4. There was a 46{\%}, 41{\%}, 51{\%}, 72{\%} and 57{\%} decline in C:N ratio of logs, stumps, small-, medium- and large roots, respectively, as decay progressed from DC 0 to 4. The density decay rates were 0.059, 0.048 and 0.036kgm-3year-1for logs, stumps and coarse roots, respectively. The size classification of roots did not significantly affect their decay rate. The half life (50{\%} decomposition) of CWD was estimated has 12-, 14- and 19years for logs, stumps and roots of Sitka spruce. Regression curves showed a strong correlation between the density and C:N ratio (R2=0.69, 0.74 and 0.93 for logs, stumps and coarse roots, respectively). The long term storage of C and its slow rate of decomposition make CWD a vital structural and functional component of the CWD C-pool and a major controller of forest ecosystem C-retention. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Frequent drying of ponded water, and support of unique, highly specialized assemblages of often rare species, characterize temporary wetlands, such as vernal pools, gilgais, and prairie potholes. As small aquatic features embedded in a terrestrial landscape, temporary wetlands enhance biodiversity and provide aesthetic, biogeochemical, and hydrologic functions. Challenges to conserving temporary wetlands include the need to: (1) integrate freshwater and terrestrial biodiversity priorities; (2) conserve entire ‘pondscapes' defined by connections to other aquatic and terrestrial systems; (3) maintain natural heterogeneity in environmental gradients across and within wetlands, especially gradients in hydroperiod; (4) address economic impact on landowners and developers; (5) act without complete inventories of these wetlands; and (6) work within limited or non-existent regulatory protections. Because temporary wetlands function as integral landscape components, not singly as isolated entities, their cumulative loss is ecologically detrimental yet not currently part of the conservation calculus. We highlight approaches that use strategies for conserving temporary wetlands in increasingly human-dominated landscapes that integrate top-down management and bottom-up collaborative approaches. Diverse conservation activities (including education, inventory, protection, sustainable management, and restoration) that reduce landowner and manager costs while achieving desired ecological objectives will have the greatest probability of success in meeting conservation goals.},

Prior experimental evidence from the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) indicating the acute embryonic sensitivity of at least four amphibian species to UV-B has been central to the literature about amphibian decline. However, these results have not been expanded to address population-scale effects and natural landscape variation in UV-B transparency of water at amphibian breeding sites: both necessary links to assess the importance of UV-B for amphibian declines.We quantified the UV-B transparency of 136 potential amphibian breeding sites to establish the pattern of UV-B exposure across two montane regions in the PNW. Our data suggest that 85{\%} of sites are naturally protected by dissolved organic matter in pond water, and that only a fraction of breeding sites are expected to experience UV-B intensities exceeding levels associated with elevated egg mortality. Thus, the spectral characteristics of natural waters likely mediate the physiological effects of UV-B on amphibian eggs in all but the clearest waters. These data imply that UV-B is unlikely to cause broad amphibian declines across the landscape of the American Northwest.},

abstract = {Investigations to determine stable or source-sink animal population dynamics are challenging and often infeasible for most species due to the time and expense of mark-recapture studies and the challenge of life histories attributes that result in low detectability and low recapture probabilities. Often, managers rely solely on occupancy or relative abundance patterns to assess a species' sensitivity to environmental changes. Greater insight into population-level responses to environmental change can be gained by consideration of a combination of readily obtainable metrics, including occupancy, relative abundance, demographic structure and body condition. We examined how these metrics can improve our understanding of population-level responses to forest disturbance, using datasets for two exemplar species of terrestrial salamanders resident to the Pacific Northwestern USA. We compared population metrics for the Del Norte salamander (Plethodon elongatus) and the Siskiyou Mountains salamander (Plethodon stormi) across the seral continuum represented by four forest age classes: pre-canopy, young, mature, and old-growth. We compared these data with those collected from reference stands in mature (P. stormi) or old-growth (P. elongatus) forest containing robust populations. P. elongatus was twice as common as P. stormi. Both occupancy and salamander counts were lowest at pre-canopy sites for both species. Although there were numerous P. elongatus detections in young forests, higher proportions of these individuals were juveniles and sub-adults when compared to populations in late-seral forests. We found a negative relationship between the proportion of immature animals and total counts at a site, indicating that the high proportion of young animals in young forest stands is likely due to dispersal of young salamanders from nearby source populations and/or low survival of adult animals in young forests. We also found reduced body condition of P. stormi populations in young forests. Our results suggest that there are costs to populations occupying early seral forests, such as skewed age class structure and reduced body condition that are indicative of sink populations. Consideration of population-level metrics beyond occupancy and relative abundance can provide important insights when assessing a species' sustainability in managed forest landscapes.},

To appropriately analyze these data, hierarchical models have been developed to separately model explanatory variables of both a latent abundance or occurrence process and a conditional detection process. Because these models have a straightforward interpretation paralleling mechanisms under which the data arose, they have recently gained immense popularity. The common hierarchical structure of these models is well-suited for a unified modeling interface.

Using 251 case studies on ecotourism from the literature, I looked at the distribution of case studies over continents, habitats and flagship species types and what factors influenced whether an ecotourism regime was perceived as ecologically sustainable by authors. Over 50{\%} of ecotourism case studies were reported from Africa and Central America. The overall distribution of ecotourism case studies did not reflect vertebrate endemism, nor overall tourism distribution in terms of tourist numbers and receipts. There were significant differences between continents and habitats with regard to the proportion of sustainable case studies: ecotourism is perceived to be less sustainable in South America and Asia, and in island and mountain habitats. The type of flagship species also influenced whether ecotourism was classified as sustainable or not: ecotourism with no flagship species was rarely classified as sustainable while charismatic bird and mammal species were associated with a higher probability of sustainability. In a multivariate analysis, flagship species type and local community involvement were important predictors of sustainability in ecotourism. Detailed a priori planning, local involvement and control measures were perceived by authors of case studies to increase the success of ecotourism in conservation. They also perceived that ecotourism can only be an effective conservation tool under certain conditions. If these are met, the evidence indicates that ecotourism can make a contribution to conservation. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {The American chestnut, Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh, has been decimated by chestnut blight which is caused by an exotic, oxalate producing pathogen, Cryphonectria parasitica (Murrill.) Barr. Many pathogenic and saprophytic fungi produce oxalate to facilitate in colonization of plant tissue, and therefore, discovering ways to protect plants from the detrimental effects of oxalate could be very beneficial. Germin-like oxalate oxidases have been found to degrade oxalate into hydrogen peroxide and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen peroxide plays several important roles in plant defense, including lignification of the plant cell wall. In this study, American chestnut wildtype callus tissue and callus tissue transformed with an oxalate oxidase gene were cultured on media containing various concentrations of oxalic acid. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to test the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin content of the calli. In the presence of oxalic acid, wildtype tissues demonstrated a significant decrease in lignin content and increase in cellulose content, while transformed tissues did not. Transforming American chestnut with an oxalate oxidase gene may prove to be useful in preventing changes in the cell wall composition caused by the oxalate produced during C. parasitica infection and could possibly enhance resistance.},

abstract = {Background: Proteochemometrics is a new methodology that allows prediction of protein function directly from real interaction measurement data without the need of 3D structure information. Several reported proteochemometric models of ligand-receptor interactions have already yielded significant insights into various forms of bio-molecular interactions. The proteochemometric models are multivariate regression models that predict binding affinity for a particular combination of features of the ligand and protein. Although proteochemometric models have already offered interesting results in various studies, no detailed statistical evaluation of their average predictive power has been performed. In particular, variable subset selection performed to date has always relied on using all available examples, a situation also encountered in microarray gene expression data analysis. Results: A methodology for an unbiased evaluation of the predictive power of proteochemometric models was implemented and results from applying it to two of the largest proteochemometric data sets yet reported are presented. A double cross-validation loop procedure is used to estimate the expected performance of a given design method. The unbiased performance estimates (P 2) obtained for the data sets that we consider confirm that properly designed single proteochemometric models have useful predictive power, but that a standard design based on cross validation may yield models with quite limited performance. The results also show that different commercial software packages employed for the design of proteochemometric models may yield very different and therefore misleading performance estimates. In addition, the differences in the models obtained in the double CV loop indicate that detailed chemical interpretation of a single proteochemometric model is uncertain when data sets are small. Conclusion: The double CV loop employed offer unbiased performance estimates about a given proteochemometric modelling procedure, making it possible to identify cases where the proteochemometric design does not result in useful predictive models. Chemical interpretations of single proteochemometric models are uncertain and should instead be based on all the models selected in the double CV loop employed here.},

abstract = {Climate change can induce shifts in species ranges. Of special interest are range shifts in regions with a conflict of interest between land use and the conservation of threatened species. Here we focus on the 94 threatened terrestrial vertebrates occurring in the Madrid region (Central Spain) and model their distributions using data for the whole peninsular Spain to evaluate which vertebrate groups are likely to be more sensitive to climatic change. First, we generated predictive models to quantify the extent to which species distributions are explained by current climate. We then extrapolated the models temporally to predict the effects of two climate-change scenarios on species distributions. We also examined the impact on a recently proposed reserve relative to other interconnected zones with lower protection status but categorized as Areas of Community Importance by the European Union. The variation explained by climatic predictors was greater in ectotherms. The change in species composition differed between the proposed reserve and the other protected areas. Endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates had different patterns of changes in species composition but those of ectotherms matched with temperature departures predicted by climate change. Our results, together with the limited dispersal capacity of herptiles, suggest that trade-offs between different design criteria accounting for animal group differences are necessary for reserve selection. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

This study examined some of the potential effects that this species shift may have had on headwater streams, focusing on processing rates and nutritional quality of chestnut versus red oak (Quercus rubra) and pignut hickory (Carya glabra), and on consumption rates and growth and fecundity of shredding macroinvertebrates fed the different leaf species.

abstract = {The consequences of individual variation in life-history traits have been well studied due to their importance in evolutionary ecology. However, a trait that has received little empirical attention is the rate of indeterminate growth. In long-lived ectotherms, subtle variation in growth after maturity could have major effects over the animals' lifetimes. These effects are difficult to measure due to the challenges involved in reliably estimating individual variation in the face of environmental stochasticity, and the need to account for trade-offs among growth, reproduction and survival. However, modelling advances have made such analysis possible if long-term high-quality datasets are available. We used an integrated state-space modelling framework to reveal relationships between indeterminate growth, reproduction and survival in a population of North American snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) using a 41-year dataset for 298 adult females. A hierarchical version of the von Bertalanffy model fitted to data on carapace lengths showed substantial individual variation in growth trajectories, and hierarchical models fitted to clutch-mass data and recapture histories showed that reproductive output and survival probability increased with size. Integration of these models revealed no detectable trade-offs—i.e., individual growth parameters were not correlated with size-specific survival or reproduction rates, and individual variation in reproductive output did not affect the size-specific survival rate. Consequently, individual variation in growth parameters was estimated to result in {\textgreater}2-fold variation in post-maturity life expectancy and {\textgreater}4-fold variation in expected lifetime reproductive output. These results illustrate that indeterminate growth can have major fitness consequences in long-lived species. We suggest that the individual variation in growth rates reflects variation in environments experienced during development or later life. An understanding of this variation may be essential for predicting the population dynamics of long-lived species under threat and identifying the most important environments to protect.

abstract = {Populations of species with complex life cycles have the potential to be regulated at multiple life history stages. However, research tends to focus on single stage density-dependence, which can lead to inaccurate conclusions about population regulation and subsequently hinder conservation efforts. In amphibians, many studies have demonstrated strong effects of larval density and have often assumed that populations are regulated at this life history stage. However, studies examining density regulation in the terrestrial stages are rare, and the functional relationships between terrestrial density and vital rates in amphibians are unknown. We determined the effects of population density on survival, growth and reproductive development in the terrestrial stage of two amphibians by raising juvenile wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and American toads (Bufo americanus) at six densities in terrestrial enclosures. Density had strong negative effects on survival, growth and reproductive development in both species. We fitted a priori recruitment functions to describe the relationship between initial density and the density of survivors after one year, and determined the functional relationship between initial density and mass after one year. Animals raised at the lowest densities experienced growth and survival rates that were over twice as great as those raised at the highest density. All female wood frogs in the lowest density treatment showed signs of reproductive development, compared to only 6{\%} in the highest density treatment. Female American toads reached minimum reproductive size only at low densities, and male wood frogs and American toads reached maturity only in the three lowest density treatments. Our results demonstrate that in the complex life cycle of amphibians, density in the terrestrial stage can reduce growth, survival and reproductive development and may play an important role in amphibian population regulation. We discuss the implications of these results for population regulation in complex life cycles and for amphibian conservation.},

abstract = {The Galapagos Archipelago is renowned for its high endemism but little effort has been made to quantify the human disturbance that compromises the islands' ecological integrity. We provide a quantitative assessment of anthropogenic degradation, which we define as areas either transformed by direct human activity or heavily invaded by four of the most prevalent alien plant species (Psidium guajava, Rubus niveus, Cinchona pubescens and Syzygium jambos). We assessed how the amount of degraded area varied among the six major vegetation zones (bare ground, littoral, arid, transition, humid and very humid) across five inhabited or formerly inhabited islands. Overall, we found that 37,833 ha (5.5{\%}) of the Archipelago have been completely degraded. The islands that have suffered the greatest human impact (13,000-14,000 ha each) are Santa Cruz (the most populous) and Isabela (the largest). When vegetation type is considered the humid and very humid vegetation zones have been most affected by humans (29 and 45{\%}, respectively). On San Cristobal and Santa Cruz 100 and 76{\%}, respectively, of the very humid zone and 94 and 88{\%}, respectively, of the humid zone have been transformed. These results are underestimations as mapping of the anthropogenic change in some vegetation zones (e.g. on Floreana) is poor, and the analysis did not take into account the effects of introduced animals. Nevertheless, this research points to an urgent need to prioritize restoration efforts in humid and very humid vegetation zones and to improve spatial mapping across the Archipelago to obtain a better understanding of the impacts of humans. {\textcopyright} 2009 Fauna {\&} Flora International.},

abstract = {Global climate change is recognized as a threat to species survival and the health of natural systems. Scientists worldwide are looking at the ecological and hydrological impacts resulting from climate change. Climate change will make future efforts to restore and manage wetlands more complex. Wetland systems are vulnerable to changes in quantity and quality of their water supply, and it is expected that climate change will have a pronounced effect on wetlands through alterations in hydrological regimes with great global variability. Wetland habitat responses to climate change and the implications for restoration will be realized differently on a regional and mega-watershed level, making it important to recognize that specific restoration and management plans will require examination by habitat. Floodplains, mangroves, seagrasses, saltmarshes, arctic wetlands, peatlands, freshwater marshes and forests are very diverse habitats, with different stressors and hence different management and restoration techniques are needed. The Sundarban (Bangladesh and India), Mekong river delta (Vietnam), and southern Ontario (Canada) are examples of major wetland complexes where the effects of climate change are evolving in different ways. Thus, successful long term restoration and management of these systems will hinge on how we choose to respond to the effects of climate change. How will we choose priorities for restoration and research? Will enough water be available to rehabilitate currently damaged, water-starved wetland ecosystems? This is a policy paper originally produced at the request of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and incorporates opinion, interpretation and scientific-based arguments. },

abstract = {Seasonal forest pools in the northeastern USA are unique ecosystems whose functions are intimately associated with adjacent upland habitats. This connection, coupled with their small size and ephemeral surface water, has made conservation of pool resources challenging. Seasonal pools provide optimal breeding habitat for animals adapted to temporary waters including ambystomatid salamanders (Ambystoma spp.), wood frogs (Rana sylvatica LeConte), and some invertebrates and plants. To date, wetland conservation efforts have been primarily limited to 2 pathways: land use regulation and preservation. Although both of these pathways have the potential to conserve some pool resources, they are often insufficient to maintain an array of pools in the landscape that support local population dynamics of amphibians. We propose a third pathway - local land-use planning - that can complement regulatory and preservation efforts. This suite of strategies, embodied in our Best Development Practices (BDPs), recognizes that not all pools will be conserved; local governances will need to develop priorities for conservation. The BDPs encourage local governances to (1) proactively identify their pool resources, (2) rank those pools according to their relative ecological value, and (3) establish management procedures and apply recommended guidelines in accordance with the relative rankings. We recommend that pools be ranked using biological criteria (e.g., presence of listed species, presence of breeding species, and egg mass abundance) and on the availability and quality of adjacent terrestrial habitat. We recommend 3 management zones: the pool depression, the pool envelope (i.e., land within 30 m of the pool), and the critical terrestrial habitat (i.e., 30-230 m from the pool). Residential, industrial, and commercial development, which may compromise pool habitat (e.g., through building and road construction, site clearing, stormwater management, and lighting), should follow the recommended guidelines presented in Appendix I of this paper. Planning at the watershed level, using such tools as overlay zones, wetland ordinances, and easements, should lead to more effective, long-term management of, at a minimum, the most ecologically important seasonal forest pool resources and will provide developers with clear development guidelines. This process is already being successfully implemented in a number of New England towns.},

annote = {Complex life cycle (CLC): "life histroy that includes abrupt, ontogenetic change in an individual's morphology, physiology, and behavior - usually associated with a change in habitat"

THESIS: "CLC's are often adaptations that exploit transient opportunities for growth or dispersal"

Pop dynamics of larval (growth) and adult (dispersal) stages are very different

Larval stage history: pulse hatching -{\textgreater} decline (either mortalities or metamorphosis)

Density dependent reg. during larval stage:
- "Growth rates of larvae are regulated by density-dependent mechanisms to levels below the physiologically maximum rate limited by the temperature regime of the pond"
- reproduction leaves the larval habitat saturated, but metamorphosis does not alone cause density-dependent effects of survival/fecundity of adults 
- Adult fecundity and survival rates are not dependent on density - they are a function of constant values or random variables (e.g. for species utilizing VPs with synchronized breeding, high fecundities, and wide dispersal over bountiful and safe habitats)
- larval period duration, metamorphosis and larval mortality rates are functions of larval density

Density dependent reg. during adult stage:
- reproduction does not leave the larval habitat saturated, but larval productivity is sufficient to maintain adult populations near carrying capacity
- metamorphosis and larval mortality rates are not a function of larval density
- adult fecundity and survival rates are partly a function of adult density
- e.g. Bullfrogs and other long-lived territorial species

Density dependent reg. during both stages
- if adult density and fecundity is large enough to saturate larval habitats and the larvae are productive enough to saturate the adult habitat
- more common among anurans

Regulation of adult pops
- territorial behavior - may be a density-dependent mechanism determining which phenotypes breed
- body size and future repro is dependent on the body size at metamorphosis (which is a function of larval density and food availability)

Regulation of larval pops
- Food availability
- Temperature 
- Predation

W = c exp (-aD) + b
W = mean body weight at meta
D = initial density of pop
b = minimum size at meta
c = range of sizes at meta
a = exp coeffient of density-dependent

Densities of larval and adult populations are independently regulated with no overlap in resources (Istock)
- "CLCs persist because of a genetic constraint in which all heritable phenotypic variance in life history traits is exhausted by nat selection before a life cycle can degenerate to the simplest case"
- the efficient exploitation of two habitats by "balancing pop regulation during both phases"

Community Ecology
- trophic connectivity and food web structure complexity is greater in communities of spp with CLCs
- each pond filling season may be independent from each other - each brings a new episode of community interaction
- Hairston related the distribution of adult salamanders across microhabitats to differences in larval habitats

Amphibians with CLCs can reduce niche overlap by: (a) breeding in different habitats, (b) exploiting different microhabitats within a pond, or (c) breeding at different times},

Shifts in average population body size could indicate either plasticity in the growth response to changing climates through changes in allocation and energetics, or through selection for decreased size where energy is limiting. We compared historic and contemporary size measurements in 15 Plethodon species from 102 populations (9450 individuals) and found that six species exhibited significant reductions in body size over 55 years. Biophysical models, accounting for actual changes in moisture and air temperature over that period, showed a 7.1-7.9{\%} increase in metabolic expenditure at three latitudes but showed no change in annual duration of activity. Reduced size was greatest at southern latitudes in regions experiencing the greatest drying and warming. Our results are consistent with a plastic response of body size to climate change through reductions in body size as mediated through increased metabolism. These rapid reductions in body size over the past few decades have significance for the susceptibility of amphibians to environmental change, and relevance for whether adaptation can keep pace with climate change in the future.},

This study compared the density of D. antarctica between 2 sites; the density remained relatively stable at site 1, whereas it severely decreased in site 2 over a period of 3 years. Although site 2 showed better soil conditions for the growth of D. antarctica such as organic matter content, available phosphorus, NO 3 -N, and extractable cations, its poor drainage and low soil pH may affected the survival of D. antarctica by altering nutrition availability and inhibiting root respiration. Poisson analysis of covariance showed that the early melting of snow was also an important factor in the distribution of D. antarctica. The results also showed that seabirds and mammals might have greatly influenced the distribution of the grass species in King George Island by transferring nutrients from the sea onto land; thus, changing the chemical characteristics of the soil. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Historical land use can influence forest species composition and structure for centuries after direct use has ceased. In Wisconsin, USA, Euro-American settlement in the mid-to late 1800s was accompanied by widespread logging, agricultural conversion, and fire suppression. To determine the maximum magnitude of change in forest ecosystems at the height of the agricultural period and the degree of recovery since that time, we assessed changes in forest species composition and structure among the (1) mid-1800s, at the onset of Euro-American settlement; (2) 1930s, at the height of the agricultural period; and (3) 2000s, following forest regrowth. Data sources included the original U.S. Public Land Survey records (mid-1800s), the Wisconsin Land Economic Inventory (1930s), and U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data (2000s). We derived maps of relative species dominance and tree diameters for the three dates and assessed change using spatial error models, nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination, and Sorenson distance measures. Our results suggest that since the mid-1800s, hemlock and white pine have declined in absolute area from 22{\%} to 1{\%}, and the proportion of medium (25-{\textless}50 cm) and large-diameter ({\^{a}}‰¥50 cm) trees of all species has decreased from 71{\%} to 27{\%} across the entire state. Early-successional aspen-birch is three times more common than in the mid-1800s (9{\%} vs. 3{\%}), and maple and other shade-tolerant species are increasing in southern areas formerly dominated by oak forests and savannas. Since the peak agricultural extent in the 1930s, species composition and tree size in northern forests have shown some recovery, while southern forests appear to be on a novel trajectory of change. There is evidence of regional homogenization, but the broad north-south environmental gradient in Wisconsin constrains overall species composition. Although the nature of the future forests will be determined in part by climate change and other exogenous variables, land use is likely to remain the driving factor. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Amphibians are declining globally, and efforts are underway to establish long-term programs to monitor population trends. Because researchers are constrained to sampling a small subset of populations that occur across a landscape, monitoring units should be selected that maximize the statistical independence of population responses to environmental stressors. Breeding sites of pond-breeding amphibians are often clustered locally, and habitat switching between neighboring ponds could significantly compromise both demographic and statistical independence. This raises a fundamental issue of whether the basic monitoring unit for trend analysis should be an individual pond or a cluster of local ponds. To help resolve the degree of demographic independence within a cluster of local ponds, we conducted a spatial-scale analysis of breeding-population synchrony of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) in four national parks in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee, USA. We used the number of egg masses deposited annually from 1993 through 2002 as an index of relative breeding-population size and used correlation coefficients of annual percentage change in population size as an index of synchrony. Within parks, synchrony for both species was independent of the distance between ponds and was lower between paired ponds within a local cluster compared with paired comparisons of geographically isolated groups. These patterns indicate a lack of demo- graphic independence within clusters and are consistent with field observations of wholesale shifting of local pond populations to adjoining ponds. Habitat shifting occurred primarily in response to beaver activity that created new ponds or allowed fish to invade fish-free habitats. Ambystoma maculatum shifted habitats less frequently and exhibited higher levels of within-cluster population synchrony than R. sylvatica. Turnovers occurred for local pond populations for both species and at higher rates for R. sylvatica. However, no local pond cluster experienced a turnover event during the study. Our data suggest that pond populations that are only a few hundred meters apart are not demographically independent and are best treated as subpopulations of the same monitoring unit. We discuss the implications of these findings for amphibian-monitoring programs that are designed to assess population trends},

Clustered ponds should be treated as a single breeding habitat with pond populations as subpopulations of the greater clustered area

Panmictic population or metapopulation in clusters?
- populations across ponds less than 400m apart function more as panmictic populations
- populations less than 100m and 200m apart (for spotteds and woods, respectively) are subpopulations of a single local population

Wood frogs and spotteds not fully philopatric in this study - site disturbances decreased philopatry

abstract = {Geographically-based threat assessments are important for identifying natural resources at risk, yet have rarely been applied to identify habitat conservation priorities for imperiled organisms at a local scale. Pool-breeding amphibians have complex life cycles that place them at risk from habitat loss and fragmentation both in wetlands and in adjacent uplands. Because the most rapidly growing cause of habitat degradation in North America has been urbanization, a threat analysis of pool-breeding amphibian habitat should both be dynamic, i.e., sensitive to land-use change, and comprehensive, recognizing traditional protected area networks as well as less formal conservation assets (e.g., land-use regulations). To assess threats to wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) in a rapidly urbanizing, forested region of New England (USA) we examined gaps in the current protection network, as well as changing human settlement patterns. We found that greater than 50{\%} of 542 potential breeding pools delineated using low-level infra-red aerial photography (median area 379.5 m2) were not represented on National Wetland Inventory (U.S.FWS) maps, and thus de facto at risk. Most importantly, conservation lands and regulatory protections failed to protect 46{\%} of potential breeding pools and 80{\%} of adjacent non-breeding habitat. While an assessment of human settlement patterns projected that only 5{\%} of the region contained high quality amphibian habitat under acute development pressure, nearly half of the region (44.7{\%}) had attained a moderate threat level, highlighting the importance of conservation planning during early stages of urbanization. We conclude by illustrating the role for multiple conservation strategies when protecting functional landscapes for pool-breeding amphibians. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In areas managed for timber, riparian areas are often protected with unharvested forested buffers, but it Is unclear whether these buffers are adequate to maintain the floral and faunal diversity of riparian areas. Amphibians are sensitive to forest management, have high diversity in riparian areas, and are among the most abundant vertebrates in temperate forests; therefore, they are excellent candidates to use in a study of the effects of riparian timber management. We conducted a field experiment with 15 headwater streams in western Maine, USA, randomly assigned to 5 silvicultural treatments. We examined amphibian abundance for 1 year prior to and 2 years following treatment. We also undertook a retrospective study on 12 headwater streams representing 3 treatments where harvests had occurred 4-10 years earlier. We used pitfall traps with drift fences and cover-controlled, active-searches to sample terrestrial and stream amphibians. Wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) were sensitive to timber harvesting along headwater streams. American toads (Bufo americanus) were either unaffected or increased in abundance postharvest. Buffers ranging in width from 11 to 35 m appeared to partially mitigate the effects of timber harvest because abundances were generally higher within the buffer than in the adjacent clearcut for wood frogs, American toads, and to a lesser extent red-backed salamanders. Partial harvests adjacent to headwater streams had the least effect on the riparian amphibian community and should be considered for harvests along headwater streams when managing at the stream scale. Our results show that managers can conduct riparian timber harvesting in a manner that allows a diverse suite of amphibian species to persist in the first years after harvest. It is plausible that these same practices may also mitigate the effects of timber harvesting on other forest species. Long-term effects of riparian timber harvesting on amphibians and other forest species population persistence and viability is a logical next step.},

abstract = {Big data offer a great opportunity for nature-based recreation (NbR) mapping and evaluation. However, it is important to determine when and how it is appropriate to use this resource. We used Scotland as a case study to validate the use of data from Flickr as an indicator of NbR on a national scale and at several regional spatial and temporal resolutions. We compared Flickr photographs to visitor statistics in the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) and determined whether temporal variability in photo counts could be explained by known annual estimates of CNP visitor numbers. We then used a unique recent national survey of nature recreation in Scotland to determine whether the spatial distribution of Flickr photos could be explained by known spatial variability in nature use. Following this validation work, we used Flickr data to identify hotspots of wildlife watching in Scotland and investigated how they changed between 2005 and 2015. We found that spatial and temporal patterns in Flickr count are explained by measures of visitation obtained through surveys and that this relationship is reliable down to a 10 Km scale resolution. Our findings have implications for planning and management of NbR as they suggest that photographs uploaded on Flickr reflect patterns of NbR at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant for ecosystem management.},
annote = {Wavelets analysis - another method for time series decomposition

Changes in popularity of crowdsourcing platforms can potentially explain temporal patterns in spatial photography (a caveat to using these methods to predict visitation and and trends overtime in photo targets). BUT, the authors did NOT find this in their study.

Very clear approach taken:

1. Demonstrate that there is a connection between Flickr photos and model-derived visitation information (i.e., STEAM).

2. Demonstrate that there is a connection between Flickr photos and nature recreation survey data.

3. Given Flickr photography is related to empirical and modeled sources of visitation information, what can you learn about trends in nature recreation from Flickr photography

5km is the highest resolution you can go with Flickr data to make reliable inferences about nature recreation. 10km is even better.},

abstract = {Aim: Over the past four centuries the eastern US has undergone remarkable landscape and land-use transformations involving deforestation, intensive agriculture, farm abandonment, reforestation and human population increase that have induced sweeping changes in wildlife assemblages, abundances, and distributions. This study compiles data on major wildlife species and seeks to identify broad population trends and to address both fundamental and applied questions regarding these long-term patterns. Location: The study encompasses the state of Massachusetts, which is broadly representative of the habitat conditions and landscape and cultural history of other New England states. Methods: A wide range of historical sources of data were used including town histories, newspaper and other popular accounts, scientific studies, museum collections, compiled trapping, bounty and harvest records, explorer accounts, and agency records. Statewide distribution maps and generalized population trends were assembled for individual species where practical, and major trends in species trajectories were identified. Emphasis was placed on mammals and birds for which data are readily available. Results: Although species exhibited highly individualistic long-term dynamics in response to habitat change and human pressure, six major trajectories of species changes are identified: (1) large mammals and birds that declined historically and increased recently, (2) open-land species that went from low to high abundance with the creation of open habitat but are in rapid decline today in the heavily wooded landscape, (3) species regionally extirpated or globally extinct, (4) species expanding their range from the west, north and south, (5) non-native, introduced species, and (6) persistent species not exhibiting major long-term trends. Currently, wildlife populations are changing at a remarkable rate leading to significant ecological impacts on the landscape and many other species, creating major conservation and management challenges, and generating novel and oftentimes significant conflicts with human values. Conclusions: The rate of historical and current changes in wildlife assemblages pose many scientific and conservation challenges, especially in this heavily forested but highly populated landscape. Historical data are fragmentary and oftentimes uncertain, modern information on wildlife populations is similarly incomplete, and small populations of species that are immigrating, expanding or declining from previously high levels pose major sampling problems; development of conservation and management plans for rapidly expanding populations of large woodland mammals (e.g. moose, coyote, deer, bears, beaver) and for declining populations of cherished species that are dependent on cultural landscapes generates conflicting directives; and educating, and modifying the behaviour of a human population that is living in but separated from nature is a difficult enterprise. The future is guaranteed to bring major dynamics in these historically novel species assemblages.},

abstract = {Despite baboons' widespread distribution across Africa, geophagy among all subspecies has been poorly documented. We used video camera traps and soil analyses to investigate geophagy in chacma baboons (Papio cynocephalus ursinus) inhabiting the Western Cape of South Africa. During an 18-month study, from August 2009 to January 2011, we continually monitored the largest and most frequently visited geophagy sites with camera traps for 545 days and captured soil consumption at one or more sites on 266 of those days (49{\%}). In 3,500 baboon visits to geophagy sites, video camera traps captured 58.6 hr of geophagy. From these data, we evaluated site preference based on time spent consuming soil among these four geophagy sites. One hundred and seventy days of soil consumption data from the most frequently visited geophagy site allowed us to look for demographic trends in geophagy. Selected consumed soils from geophagy sites were analyzed for mineral, physical, and chemical properties. The baboons spent more time consuming white alkaline soils with high percentages of clay and fine silt, which contained higher concentrations of sodium than non-white acidic soils that contained higher concentrations of iron. Our data indicate that pregnant chacma baboons spent more time consuming soil at monitored geophagy sites than baboons of any other age class, sex, or reproductive state. Based on analytical results, the soils consumed would be effective at alleviating gastrointestinal distress and possibly supplementing minerals for all age/sex classes, but potentially for different age/sex requirements.},

abstract = {A large number of factors are known to affect amphibian population viability, but most authors agree that the principal causes of amphibian declines are habitat loss, alteration, and fragmentation. We provide a global assessment of land use dynamics in the context of amphibian distributions. We accomplished this by compiling global maps of amphibian species richness and recent rates of change in land cover, land use, and human population growth. The amphibian map was developed using a combination of published literature and digital databases. We used an ecoregion framework to help interpret species distributions across environmental, rather than political, boundaries. We mapped rates of land cover and use change with statistics from the World Resources Institute, refined with a global digital dataset on land cover derived from satellite data. Temporal maps of human population were developed from the World Resources Institute database and other published sources. Our resultant map of amphibian species richness illustrates that amphibians are distributed in an uneven pattern around the globe, preferring terrestrial and freshwater habitats in ecoregions that are warm and moist. Spatiotemporal patterns of human population show that, prior to the 20th century, population growth and spread was slower, most extensive in the temperate ecoregions, and largely exclusive of major regions of high amphibian richness. Since the beginning of the 20th century, human population growth has been exponential and has occurred largely in the subtropical and tropical ecoregions favored by amphibians. Population growth has been accompanied by broad-scale changes in land cover and land use, typically in support of agriculture. We merged information on land cover, land use, and human population growth to generate a composite map showing the rates at which humans have been changing the world. When compared with the map of amphibian species richness, we found that many of the regions of the earth supporting the richest assemblages of amphibians are currently undergoing the highest rates of landscape modification.},

abstract = {Vehicular traffic can be a major source of mortality for some species. Highly vagile organisms may be at a disadvantage in landscapes with roads because they are more likely to encounter roads and incur traffic mortality. To test this prediction, we assessed the population abundance of two anuran species of differing vagility, the leopard frog (Rana pipiens, more vagile) and the green frog (Rana clamitans, less vagile), at 30 breeding ponds. Traffic density, an index of the amount of potential traffic mortality, was measured in concentric circles radiating from the ponds out to 5 km. We conducted multiple linear regressions relating population abundance to traffic density, pond variables, and landscape habitat variables and found that leopard frog population density was negatively affected by traffic density within a radius of 1.5 km. There was no evidence that the presence of vehicular traffic affected green frog populations. These results suggest that traffic mortality can cause population declines and that more vagile species may be more vulnerable to road mortality than less vagile species.},

abstract = {Historically, ecological risk assessments have rarely included amphibian species, focusing preferentially on other aquatic (fish, invertebrates, algae) and terrestrial wildlife (birds and mammal) species. Often this lack of consideration is due to a paucity of toxicity data, significant variation in study design, uncertainty with regard to exposure, or a combination of all three. Productive risk assessments for amphibians are particularly challenging, given variations in complex life history strategies. Further consideration is needed for the development of useful laboratory animal models and appropriate experimental test procedures that can be effectively applied to the examination of biological response patterns. Using these standardized techniques, risk estimates can be more accurately defined to ensure adequate protection of amphibians from a variety of stress agents. Patterns in toxicity may help to ascertain whether test results from 1 amphibian group (e.g., Urodela) could be sufficiently protective of another (e.g., Anura) and/or whether some nonamphibian aquatic taxonomic groups (e.g., fish or aquatic invertebrates) may be representative of aquatic amphibian life stages. This scope is intended to be a guide in the development of methods that would yield data appropriate for ecological risk decisions applicable to amphibians.},

abstract = {Human land use has modified the structure and function of terrestrial landscapes throughout much of the world, with cropping and livestock grazing the major drivers of landscape change. In many tropical, sub-tropical, temperate and Mediterranean regions, regrowth forests regenerate naturally on abandoned agricultural land if human disturbance declines. With the exception of some tropical forest literature, the broader ecological and conservation literature has largely ignored the potential of regrowth forests to facilitate passive landscape restoration and the recovery of fauna communities in fragmented agricultural landscapes. This paper addresses this deficiency by reviewing the available global evidence of fauna recovery in regrowth forest from 68 papers, identifying the main gaps in current knowledge, and providing directions for further research. The majority of reviewed studies focus on regrowth in tropical regions, which often contain large areas of mature forest. Species' utilisation of regrowth forest is highly variable and is particularly influenced by land-use history, an important determinant of the structural and compositional characteristics of regrowth forests. While site-scale ({\textless}1 ha) forest structure and floristic diversity were frequently studied, only 11 studies considered the spatial configuration and context of habitat patches and just two studies explicitly considered landscape structure. Based on this review, six key research questions are posed to direct future research on this important issue. We conclude that a broader perspective of the role of regrowth forest in the landscape is required if we are to realise the potential benefits of regrowth forest for passive landscape restoration and fauna conservation and recovery. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We used aquatic mesocosms to test the impacts of variable precipitation on population dynamics of common mosquito (Culicidae) and midge (Chironomidae) larvae that inhabit vernal pools. In a mixed deciduous forest in northern Vermont, USA, we orthogonally crossed seven levels of mean water level (increased rainfall) with seven levels of water level coeffi cient of variation (more variable rainfall) to simulate a broad array of climate change scenarios in 49 experimental mesocosms. Th e average abundance of Culicidae was highest at low water levels, whereas the average abundance of Chironomidae was highest at higher water levels and low variability in water level. Treatments and environmental and spatial covariates collectively explained 49{\%} of the variance in mean abundance. For both taxa, we fi t hierarchical Bayesian models to each 16-week time series to estimate the parameters in a Gompertz logistic equation of population growth with density dependence. We found that Culicidae population growth rate increased with decreasing water levels and that 87{\%} of the variance in Chironomidae density dependence could be explained by treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that climate change can alter abundances aquatic invertebrate taxa but not necessarily through the same mechanism on all populations. In the case of Culicidae the abundance is aff ected by changes in growth rate, and in Chironomidae by changes in the strength of density dependence.},

abstract = {In order to evaluate the effects of habitat loss and degradation on amphibian populations it is necessary to determine species-specific habitat use and how this influences abundance. While a number of studies have examined the influence of competition and predation in stream salamander assemblages in the southern Appalachian Mountains, there remains a relative lack of knowledge on the microhabitat use of these species. Using area-constrained daytime searches, we investigated microhabitat use and abundance for stream-breeding salamanders in mature forests in southern Appalachian streams from May to August 2004. We found that leaf litter depth, soil moisture, and canopy cover were all higher and soil temperature was lower in plots where stream salamanders were encountered compared to plots where salamanders were not encountered. A regression analysis using the information-theoretic approach (AIC) revealed that the model that included distance from stream, leaf litter depth, soil moisture, and soil temperature had the strongest support for predicting stream salamander abundance at the landscape level ($\omega$i = 0.99). Microhabitat use in many species of stream salamanders is mediated by a number of complex factors including environmental variables, competition, and predation. Alteration of habitats likely results in increased competition and predation rates and subsequent local population declines, so it is imperative to mitigate the effects of practices such as even-aged timber harvesting in order to conserve amphibian biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Small quadrats were intensively sampled three times during one summer and habitat data were recorded in each plot. They used AIC for model selection, creating a priori and post-hoc models to make inferences. Their analysis seemed slightly unorthodox, at least by modern standards. The authors make no mention of how they synthesized their three separate rounds of amphibian data - were abundances averaged? Added? They developed post-hoc models to further break-down their global model, which was the highest ranked of their a priori models. Can you do this in AIC without a penalty (like you would receive for doing a Tukey's HSD or similar post-hoc test for ANOVA)?


Burton and Likens (1975) is a solid reference for discussing biomass of salamanders compared to other terrestrial vertebrates in eastern forests

Majority of dusky salamanders in southern Appalachia are found within 15m of stream edge

Leaf-litter quadrat study - stream salamanders were more often found in plots with deeper leaf litter, higher soil moisture, thicker canopy cover, and lower soil temperatures.

Leaf-litter depth and soil moisture appear to be the common denominator variables for predicting stream salamander abundance.},

We measured organic content in the foregut of tadpoles and from their feces, Estimates of assimilation efficiency were lower than those reported for tadpoles consuming artificial food, Both species experienced reduced assimilation efficiency on closed canopy food resources, but did not differ in their abilities to assimilate organic matter from either type of food resource, However, wood frogs processed more food during the experiment. Our results suggest that natural variation in composition Of food resources among ponds could have important effects on tadpole performance and provide some support For interspecific differences in food utilization consistent with relative patterns of performance and distribution.},

abstract = {We investigated the response of Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae), the spring salamander, to timber harvest in headwater streams in New Hampshire (U.S.A.). We conducted cover-controlled, whole-stream surveys for G. porphyriticus in 25 first-order streams in drainages encompassing a range of timber-harvest histories. Streams in two different landscape configurations were chosen, isolated, or paired, based on the presence or absence of a confluent first-order stream-a potential source of immigrants. The analyzed salamander abundance with respect to logging history, presence of the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), salamander population connectivity, and other measures of physical habitat and aquatic conditions. In stepwise multiple-regression analysis, the best multivariate model of G. porphyriticus abundance included fish presence/absence; effect category, a combined junction of years since harvest and substrate embeddedness by fine sediment; and landscape configuration. These three factors explained 74{\%} of the variation in G. porphyriticus abundance. G. porphyriticus was less abundant in streams where fish were present, likely because of predation by S. fontinalis or asymmetric competition between these species. Abundance also declined with increasing substrate embeddedness and/or decreasing years since harvest, indicating an effect of fine sediment inputs and harvest history on this species. Finally, G. porphyriticus was less abundant in isolated streams than in paired streams, This result suggests that landscape-scale population connectivity may buffer this species from the negative effects of local (i.e., stream-scale) habitat perturbation. We hope this work will encourage others to develop multiscale models of land-use effects on stream biota and thereby ultimately increase the range and effectiveness of conservation strategies for these species.},

abstract = {Drought is onee of the major natural hazards affecting the environment and economy of countries worldwide. Reliance on weather data alone is not sufficient to monitor areas of drought, particularly when these data can be untimely, sparse, and incomplete. Augmenting weather data with satellite images to identify the location and severity of droughts is a must for complete, up-to-date, and comprehensive coverage of current drought conditions. The objective of this research was to standardize, by time of year, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to augment drought-monitoring techniques. The Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) describes the probability of vegetation condition deviation from "normal," based on calculations from weekly NDVI values. The study was conducted with 12 years (1989-2000) of Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images. Z-scores of the NDVI distribution are used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the present vegetation condition at a given location relative to the possible range of vegetative vigor, historically. The SVI can be interpreted as vegetation condition based on the fact that vegetation is an efficient integrator of climatic and anthropogenic impacts in the boundary layer of the atmosphere. It thereby provides a spatially and temporally continuous short-term indicator of climatic conditions. Findings indicate that the SVI, along with other drought monitoring tools, is useful for assessing the extent and severity of drought at a spatial resolution of 1 km. The SVI is capable of providing a near-real-time indicator of vegetation condition within drought regions, and more specifically areas of varying drought conditions.},

Populations were estimated using pitfall trapping conducted during July 1997-June 1998 in the Southern Blue Ridge Province of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Salamander diversity did not differ among land use categories; however, abundances were greater in the older, least-altered stands. Abundances were positively correlated with late successional qualities of forest, such as increased domination by mesophytic tree species and increased availability of wood debris. However, we did not find large differences between stands that had experienced previous agricultural uses and those that had not been farmed, only logged. At our sites, enough time had passed since agricultural use that any differences between agricultural and forestry uses had diminished. These results show both the sensitivity of salamanders to past habitat alterations and the resiliency of these populations in their ability to recover in these ecosystems given sufficient time. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

These patterns were not statistically significant for every species; and there were some species-specific effects. They compared abundances in three different types of sites: former agriculture, former logging, and no disturbance. They used arrays of open pitfall traps with formalin to sample amphibians and employed a three-tiered habitat sampling method that looked at canopy, subcanopy, and ground covariates (Dueser and Shugart, 1978). Least altered stands had larger trees, greater abundance of mesophytic species, and higher CWD volumes. Salamander abundances were correlated with canopy cover (neg), total basal area (pos), and amounts of CWD (pos). Several species displayed contrasting or different magnitudes of responses. Dusky salamanders were most abundant in primary forests and least abundant in post-agricultural secondary forests.

Using Clymo's (1984) model, the current rate is estimated at 0.076 Pg/yr. Long- term drainage of these peatlands is estimated to be causing the oxidation to CO2 of a little more than 0.0085 Pg/yr, with combustion of fuel peat adding st0.026 Pg/yr. Emissions of CH4 are estimated to release n0.046 Pg of carbon annually. Uncertainties beset estimates of both stocks and fluxes, particularly with regard to Soviet peatlands. The influence of water table alterations upon fluxes of both CO2 and CH4 is in great need of investigation over a wide range of peatland environments, especially in regions where permafrost melting, thermokarst erosion, and the development of thaw lakes are likely results of climatic warming. The role of fire in the carbon cycle of peatlands also deserves increased attention. Finally, satellite-monitoring of the abundance of open water in the peatlands of the West Siberian Plain and the Hudson/James Bay Lowland is suggested as a likely method of detecting early effects of climatic warming upon boreal and subarctic peatlands.},

abstract = {Understanding the impacts of landscape-level processes on the population biology of amphibians is critical, especially for species inhabiting anthropogenically modified landscapes. Many pond-breeding amphibians are presumed to exist as metapopulations, but few studies demonstrate the extent and consequences of this metapopulation structure. Gene flow measures may facilitate the construction of more realistic models of population structure than direct measures of migration. This is especially true for species that are cryptic, such as many amphibians. We used eight polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the genetic population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) breeding at 17 ponds in northeastern Ohio, a landscape fragmented by roads, agriculture, urban areas and the Cuyahoga River. Using a variety of analyses (Bayesian clustering, F-statistics, AMOVA) we generated a model of salamander population genetic structure. Our data revealed patterns of genetic connectivity that were not predicted by geographical distances between ponds (no isolation by distance). We also tested for a relationship between population structure and several indices of landscape resistance, but found no effect of potential barriers to dispersal on genetic connectivity. Strong overall connectivity among ponds, despite the hostile habitat matrix, may be facilitated by a network of riparian corridors associated with the Cuyahoga River; however, high gene flow in this system may indicate a general ability to disperse and colonize beyond particular corridors.},

abstract = {Amphibians can be important consumers in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and may represent an important energetic link between the two, particularly in the tropics, where amphibian species richness and abundance are high. In the past 20 years, amphibian populations have declined dramatically around the world; numbers have decreased catastrophically in protected upland sites throughout the neotropics, usually resulting in the disappearance of over 75{\%} of amphibians at a given site, particularly those species that breed in streams. Most studies of amphibian declines have focused on identifying causes and documenting changes in adult abundance, rather than on their ecological consequences. Here, we review evidence for the potential ecological effects of catastrophic amphibian declines, focusing on neotropical highland streams, where impacts will likely be greatest. Evidence to date suggests that amphibian declines will have large-scale and lasting ecosystem-level effects, including changes in algal community structure and primary production, altered organic matter dynamics, changes in other consumers such as aquatic insects and riparian predators, and reduced energy transfers between streams and riparian habitats. Furthermore, because of habitat and functional differences between larvae and adults in most amphibians, the loss of a single species is akin to losing two species. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Kroll, Hayes {\&} MacCracken (in press) Concerns regarding the use of amphibians as metrics of critical biological thresholds: a comment on Welsh and Hodgson 2008. Freshwater Biology, criticised our paper [Welsh {\&} Hodgson (2008) Amphibians as metrics of critical biological thresholds in forested headwater streams of the Pacific Northwest. Freshwater Biology, 53, 1470-1488] proposing the use of headwater stream amphibians as metrics of stream status in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). They argued that our analysis of previously published data reflected circular reasoning because we reached the same conclusions as the earlier studies. In fact, we conducted a meta-analysis to address new questions about the optimum values and thresholds (based on animal densities) for abiotic stream attributes that were found to be important to these amphibians in earlier studies. This is analogous to determining blood pressure thresholds or fat-to-weight ratios that facilitate predicting human health based on meta-analyses of earlier data from studies that found significant correlations between these variables and relative health. Kroll et al. argued that we should not make inference to environmental conditions across the PNW from data collected in California. We collected data from northern California and southern Oregon, the southern extent of the PNW. We made inference to the Klamath-Siskiyou and North Coast bioregions, and argued that available research on these headwater species indicates that our results have the potential to be applied throughout the PNW with minimal regional adjustments. Kroll et al. contended that we need reproductive success, survival estimates and density estimates, corrected for detection probabilities, to establish relationships between animal density and stream attributes. Reproductive success and survival estimates are important for demographic modelling and life tables, but they are not necessary to demonstrate meaningful relationships with abiotic conditions. Both corrected occupancy estimates and individual detection probabilities are unnecessary, and take multiple sampling efforts per site, or onerous mark release and re-capture studies, respectively, to determine accurately. Kroll et al. questioned the use of stream amphibians as a surrogate for measuring physical parameters, such as water temperature, claiming that measuring the physical parameters directly is more efficient. Here they misinterpreted the main point of our paper: stream organisms are integrators of what happens in a catchment, and carefully selected species can serve as surrogates for the biotic community and the relative condition of the network environment. Kroll et al. claimed that we demonstrated weak inferences regarding ecosystem processes. We argue that by relating densities of stream amphibians with changes along abiotic environmental gradients that are commonly affected by anthropogenic activities, we are establishing biological links to gradients that represent important ecosystem processes and identifying biometrics that can be used to quantify the status (health) of these gradients.},

abstract = {Amphibians share several biological characteristics that may cause them to be sensitive to abrupt transitions in microhabitat and microclimate that occur across forest edges. To better understand the impor- tance of edge effects on amphibians in aforested landscape, we sampled the distribution ofpopulations along drift fences placed perpendicular to silvicultural edges of varying contrast in central Maine. Within the com- munity of amphibians sampled (14 species), salamanders generally were more sensitive to even-aged harvest- ing and associated edge effects than were anurans, but forest habitat generalists and specialists were identi- fied within both groups. We conservatively estimated the depth of edge effects at 25-35 m for a subset of management-sensitive species (Plethodon cinereus, Ambystoma maculatum, A. laterale, and Rana sylvatica). An index of edge contrast, calculated using ambient light penetration levels, was valuable in predicting the mag- nitude of edge effects among sites that included silvicultural edges of different age and origin (old field plan- tations versus recent clearcuts). Some structural microhabitat variables relevant to forest management were identified as potentially limiting to amphibians near forest edges, including canopy cover, litter cover, and a measure of stumps, snags, and their root channels. Our observations are consistent with the results of other work on biotic edge effects in the eastern United States and suggest that impacts from intensive forest man- agement practices extend beyond the boundaries of harvested stands.},
annote = {An important study on edge effects and amphibians comparing abundances between different forest treatments. They measured many habitat variables and abundances of amphibians with pitfall traps along paired transects covering a gradient from recently disturbed to undisturbed primary forest. There were clear differences between amphibian responses to forest edges and their effect on habitat: anuran and especially salamander abundances and species richness were signficantly lower in recently disturbed forest stands with lower amounts of canopy cover, snag and stump cover, and litter characteristics. No relationship was observed with CWD - though there are other important CWD metrics besides average cover that were not measured. For many species, abundances increased also with increasing proximity to forest interior locations, indicating that forest management (excluding clearcutting) doesn't cause an all-or-nothing response by frogs and salamanders. Red-backed Salamanders displayed a particularly strong response, likely due to its sole reliance on terrestrial habitats as a direct development upland species. The authors argue that the effects of edges can persist 25-35 m into the forest from the disturbance site. 

Forest management - habitat alteration
Forest edges - changes in biotic and abiotic elements that cause negative edge effects in biological communities

Forest management gets a lot of attention for amphibians, but forest fragmentation is largely unstudied

Spatially paired data - pitfall traps and plot surveys within 2m radius of pitfall station

Many species prefered closed-canopy mature stands; no preference for early successional forest habitat

Significant positive correlation between canopy cover and management sensistive species (red-backed salamanders, mole salamanders, wood frogs)

Significant relationships between local canopy cover, percent cover by snags, stumps, and associated root channels, litter characteristics, and logging disturbances (negative)

abstract = {There is concern over the fate of surface water bodies at high latitudes as a consequence of rising global temperatures. The goal of this study is to characterize climatic change that has occurred in the northern Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), Canada, from 1943 to 2009, to determine if this has resulted in a change to pond surface areas and to predict if changes may continue in the future. Climate change and changes to pond volume and size over the past ∼60 years were examined using a combination of field methods/instrumental records (1943-2009), modeling (1953-2009; 1961-2100), and remote sensing/imagery analyses (1947-2008). Results demonstrate that temperatures are warming and breakup dates are earlier, but this has not significantly increased the duration of the open-water period or pond evaporation rates, which can be highly variable from year to year. Annual precipitation, primarily summer rainfall, has increased, lessening the summer moisture deficit and leading to wetter conditions. The observed changes of a smaller summer moisture deficit are predicted to continue in future, although there is less certainty with predictions of future precipitation than there is with predictions of air temperature. Thus, ponds are likely not at risk for drying and instead may be at risk for expansion. Despite the increases in summer rainfall, imagery analysis of 100 ponds shows that pond surface areas have fluctuated over the study period but have not increased in size. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We used bird abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, land-use data from the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration, and weather data from the National Climatic Data and Information Archive to model effects of regional environmental variables on bird abundance. Models were constructed a priori using information from published habitat associations in the literature, and fitting was performed with WinBUGS using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Both land-use and climate variables contributed to predicting bird abundance in CA-BCR11, although climate predictors contributed the most to improving model fit. Examination of regional effects of climate and land use on wetland birds in CA-BCR11 revealed relationships with environmental covariates that are often overlooked by small-scale habitat studies.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors. Long-term population history can influence the genetic effects of recent bottlenecks. Therefore, for threatened or endangered species, an understanding of the past is relevant when formulating conservation strategies. Levels of variation at neutral markers have been useful for estimating local effective population sizes (Ne) and inferring whether population sizes increased or decreased over time. Furthermore, analyses of genotypic, allelic frequency, and phylogenetic information can potentially be used to separate historical from recent demographic changes. For 15 populations of Gal{\'{a}}pagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis sp.), we used 12 microsatellite loci and DNA sequences from the mitochondrial control region and a nuclear intron, to reconstruct demographic history on shallow (past {\~{}}100 generations, {\~{}}2500 years) and deep (pre-Holocene, {\textgreater}10 thousand years ago) timescales. At the deep timescale, three populations showed strong signals of growth, but with different magnitudes and timing, indicating different underlying causes. Furthermore, estimated historical Neof populations across the archipelago showed no correlation with island age or size, underscoring the complexity of predicting demographic history a priori. At the shallow timescale, all populations carried some signature of a genetic bottleneck, and for 12 populations, point estimates of contemporary Newere very small (i.e., {\textless} 50). On the basis of the comparison of these genetic estimates with published census size data, Negenerally represented {\~{}}0.16 of the census size. However, the variance in this ratio across populations was considerable. Overall, our data suggest that idiosyncratic and geographically localized forces shaped the demographic history of tortoise populations. Furthermore, from a conservation perspective, the separation of demographic events occurring on shallow versus deep timescales permits the identification of naturally rare versus newly rare populations; this distinction should facilitate prioritization of management action.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTResearchers commonly use p-values to answer the question: How strongly does the evidence favor the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis? p-Values themselves do not directly answer this question and are often misinterpreted in ways that lead to overstating the evidence against the null hypothesis. Even in the ?post p?{\textless}?0.05 era,? however, it is quite possible that p-values will continue to be widely reported and used to assess the strength of evidence (if for no other reason than the widespread availability and use of statistical software that routinely produces p-values and thereby implicitly advocates for their use). If so, the potential for misinterpretation will persist. In this article, we recommend three practices that would help researchers more accurately interpret p-values. Each of the three recommended practices involves interpreting p-values in light of their corresponding ?Bayes factor bound,? which is the largest odds in favor of the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis that is consistent with the observed data. The Bayes factor bound generally indicates that a given p-value provides weaker evidence against the null hypothesis than typically assumed. We therefore believe that our recommendations can guard against some of the most harmful p-value misinterpretations. In research communities that are deeply attached to reliance on ?p?{\textless}?0.05,? our recommendations will serve as initial steps away from this attachment. We emphasize that our recommendations are intended merely as initial, temporary steps and that many further steps will need to be taken to reach the ultimate destination: a holistic interpretation of statistical evidence that fully conforms to the principles laid out in the ASA statement on statistical significance and p-values.},

abstract = {Loss of biodiversity poses one of the greatest threats to natural ecosystems throughout the world. However, a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of species losses from upper trophic levels is still emerging. Here we compare the impacts of large mammalian herbivore species loss on grassland plant community structure and composition in a South African and North American grassland. Herbaceous plant communities were surveyed at sites without large mammalian herbivores present and at sites with a single species of herbivore present in both locations, and additionally at one site in South Africa with multiple herbivore species. At both the North American and South African locations, plant communities on sites with a single herbivore species were more diverse and species rich than on sites with no herbivores. At the multi-herbivore site in South Africa, plant diversity and richness were comparable to that of the single herbivore site early in the growing season and to the no herbivore site late in the growing season. Analyses of plant community composition, however, indicated strong differences between the multi-herbivore site and the single and no herbivore sites, which were more similar to each other. In moderate to high-productivity ecosystems with one or a few species of large herbivores, loss of herbivores can cause a significant decrease in plant diversity and richness, and can have pronounced impacts on grassland plant community composition. In ecosystems with higher herbivore richness, species loss may also significantly alter plant community structure and composition, although standard metrics of community structure may obscure these differences. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America. Model choice is usually an inevitable source of uncertainty in model-based statistical analyses. While the focus of model choice was traditionally on methods for choosing a single model, methods to formally account for multiple models within a single analysis are now accessible to many researchers. The specific technique of model averaging was developed to improve predictive ability by combining predictions from a set of models. However, it is now often used to average regression coefficients across multiple models with the ultimate goal of capturing a variable's overall effect. This use of model averaging implicitly assumes the same parameter exists across models so that averaging is sensible. While this assumption may initially seem tenable, regression coefficients associated with particular explanatory variables may not hold equivalent interpretations across all of the models in which they appear, making explanatory inference about covariates challenging. Accessibility to easily implementable software, concerns about being criticized for ignoring model uncertainty, and the chance to avoid having to justify choice of a final model have all led to the increasing popularity of model averaging in practice. We see a gap between the theoretical development of model averaging and its current use in practice, potentially leaving well-intentioned researchers with unclear inferences or difficulties justifying reasons for using (or not using) model averaging. We attempt to narrow this gap by revisiting some relevant foundations of regression modeling, suggesting more explicit notation and graphical tools, and discussing how individual model results are combined to obtain a model averaged result. Our goal is to help researchers make informed decisions about model averaging and to encourage question-focused modeling over method-focused modeling.},

abstract = {Harvest of forest biomass, specifically downed woody material (DWM), will increase to meet rising demand for alternative energy sources. Biomass harvest may reduce habitat quality, abundance, and regional diversity of forest-dependent species such as amphibians. We synthesize available literature conducted in landscapes managed for timber production to (1) assess the current state of knowledge regarding DWM management and amphibian population dynamics and (2) identify pertinent research gaps for future biomass studies. In general, the 25 studies we reviewed reported that amphibian counts were positively correlated with DWM levels. Although studies involving terrestrial salamanders often stressed the importance of retaining DWM in harvested systems, empirical support for this conclusion is uncertain due to study- and species-specific variation in responses. Lack of a DWM effect was often attributed to downed wood that was not well decayed or was too small for amphibian use. We identified several critical research needs, including: (1) understanding temporal dynamics of DWM (e.g., recruitment and decay rates) in regenerating forests and its influence on amphibian populations, (2) determining how amphibian use of harvest units relates to configuration and characteristics of DWM, (3) understanding how DWM management influences amphibian demographic rates, and (4) development of sampling and analytical techniques that support separation of sampling error and ecological effects. We suggest that future studies estimate effects of biomass harvest and identify, test, and refine operational harvest strategies that minimize impacts to amphibian populations. We emphasize research should be conducted at scales relevant to management; specifically, stand and landscape scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The ecosystem services concept is increasingly gaining momentum in land-use policies and landscape planning. Yet, cultural ecosystem services often lack proper assessments. With this study, we use novel methodological approaches to map the cultural ecosystem service landscape aesthetics for its enhanced consideration in land-use policies. Our study uses expert-based participatory mapping and crowd-sourced (social media) photo data to examine the spatial distribution of landscape aesthetics in the Province of Barcelona, Catalonia. We distinguish the capacity and flow of landscape aesthetics. Landscape aesthetics capacity was assessed through spatial multi-criteria evaluation, consisting of a viewshed analysis and an expert-based selection and weighting of landscape features. Landscape aesthetics flow, i.e., people's actual appreciation of landscape aesthetics, was assessed by analysing a sample of 13,460 geolocated photographs from the social media platform Flickr. Our results uncover a substantial mismatch between landscape aesthetics capacity and flow. While landscape aesthetics capacity is widely distributed across the case study area, landscape aesthetics flow is (with few exceptions) mostly concentrated in urban and periurban areas. The main insights for land-use policies derived from our results are twofold. On one hand, landscape aesthetics flow seems less dependent on ‘pristine nature' than experts and planners assume, while the complex integration of green and grey landscape features plays a critical role. On the other hand, urban and periurban landscapes as key landscape aesthetics providers should receive additional attention in land-use policies.},

Subsequent biological inference and interpretation of model parameters depend on these definitions and the ability to meet model assumptions. 4. Wedemonstrate the relevance of these definitions by highlighting applications from a single biological system (an amphibian–pathogen system) and discuss situations where the use of occupancy models has been criticized.

@article{Amrhein2019,
abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

The enclosures were subsequently used in experiments involving (i) removal of small-mammal burrows to determine if burrow abundance influenced salamander density and (ii) manipulation of salamander densities to determine if increased density was associated with decreased growth, fecundity, or probability of re-emerging to breed. Mean density of salamanders wintering in enclosures {\textless}65 m from the breeding ponds was 1.0/100 m² (SD = 1.1/100 m², n = 17, rang =- 0-4.0/100 m²). Density declined as distance to the nearest breeding pond increased, and the sex ratio was skewed sharply toward males (8:1) wintering close ({\textless}65 m) to the pond but not farther from the pond (1:1). Males residing within the enclosures weighed more than males wintering farther from the breeding ponds. Migrating salamanders were over 3 times more likely to leave burrow-removal plots than control plots prior to the summer inactive period. Salamanders housed at high density (15/enclosure) were less likely to re-emerge to breed than were salamanders housed at low density (5/enclosure), but we observed no effects on growth or fecundity.

abstract = {During the 20th century, large agricultural areas in Eastern Europe became forested after their abandonment. To explore the value of these new forests for biota, we assessed volumes of coarse woody debris (CWD) on random transects in mid-aged (40-75 years old) stands. In mixed and deciduous forests that were not forested in the 1930s, downed tree (log) volumes were about two times lower than in cutover sites. The effect on snag volume depended on site type and was generally nonsignificant. Large-diameter CWD showed similar proportions in the long-term and new forest areas, but large, well-decayed trunks tended to be less frequent in the latter. No reduction of dead wood volume was found in new pine stands, 98{\%} of which had previously been classified as mires (bogs). Hence the origin of mid-aged successional forests had affected their CWD supply (particularly logs) to some extent, but the general scarcity of CWD all over the forest land indicated much larger (at least five-fold) losses due to timber harvesting. We conclude that naturally reforested areas should not be automatically excluded from reserve establishment or other CWD-related conservation programmes. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {In ecology, researchers frequently use observational studies to explain a given pattern, such as the number of individuals in a habitat patch, with a large number of explanatory (i.e., independent) variables. To elucidate such relationships, ecologists have long relied on hypothesis testing to include or exclude variables in regression models, although the conclusions often depend on the approach used (e.g., forward, backward, stepwise selection). Though better tools have surfaced in the mid 1970's, they are still underutilized in certain fields, particularly in herpetology. This is the case of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) which is remarkably superior in model selection (i.e., variable selection) than hypothesis-based approaches. It is simple to compute and easy to understand, but more importantly, for a given data set, it provides a measure of the strength of evidence for each model that represents a plausible biological hypothesis relative to the entire set of models considered. Using this approach, one can then compute a weighted average of the estimate and standard error for any given variable of interest across all the models considered. This procedure, termed model-averaging or multimodel inference, yields precise and robust estimates. In this paper, I illustrate the use of the AIC in model selection and inference, as well as the interpretation of results analysed in this framework with two real herpetological data sets. The AIC and measures derived from it is should be routinely adopted by herpetologists.},

Our holistic review presents a broad array of evidence that illustrates convincingly; the Arctic is undergoing a system-wide response to an altered climatic state. New extreme and seasonal surface climatic conditions are being experienced, a range of biophysical states and processes influenced by the threshold and phase change of freezing point are being altered, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles are shifting, and more regularly human sub-systems are being affected. Importantly, the patterns, magnitude and mechanisms of change have sometimes been unpredictable or difficult to isolate due to compounding factors.

abstract = {A critical threshold exists when the relationship between the amount of suitable habitat and population density or probability of occurrence exhibits a sudden, disproportionate decline as habitat is lost. Critical thresholds are predicted by a variety of modeling approaches, but empirical support has been limited or lacking. We looked for critical thresholds in two pool-breeding amphibians that spend most of the year in adjacent upland forest: the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) and the wood frog (Rana sylvatica). These species were selected because of their reported poor dispersal capacities and their dependency on forest habitat when not breeding. Using piecewise regression and binomial change-point tests, we looked for a relationship between the probability of oc- cupancy of a site and forest cover at five spatial scales, measuring forest cover in radial distances from the pond edge of suitable breeding ponds: 30 m, 100 m, 300 m, 500 m, and 1000 m. Using piecewise regression, we identified significant thresholds for spotted sala- manders at the 100-m and 300-m spatial scale, and for wood frogs at the 300-m scale. However, binomial change-point tests identified thresholds at all spatial scales for both species, with the location of the threshold (percent habitat cover required) increasing with spatial scale for spotted salamanders and decreasing with spatial scale for wood frogs. Thresholds for spotted salamanders occurred at -30{\%} forest cover at spatial scales of 100 m or less, with 41{\%} cover at 500 m, and with 51{\%} habitat cover at 1000 m. Thresholds for wood frogs ranged from 88{\%} habitat cover at 30 m from the pond edge, declining to 44{\%} habitat cover within 1000 m. These patterns might be explained by the different winter dispersions of these species. Knowing whether a species has a critical threshold, and at what level of cover and at what spatial scale it exists, would be essential for conservation of habitat-sensitive species.},
annote = {Estimated habitat thresholds for pool-breeding amphibians by sampling wetlands for species presence and calculating surrounding forest cover using aerial imagery over a series of distances from each wetland. Different thresholds were found for Wood Frogs and Spotted Salamanders. Wood Frogs have a higher sensitivity to habitat loss closer to breeding habitats, likely due to their disproportionate of habitats closest to ponds in the winter. The authors estimated a critical threshold of 88{\%} forest cover within 30 m from a pond edge. This threshold value decreased as the distance from the pond increased. A reverse threshold effect was observed for Spotted Salamanders, which only required 32{\%} forest cover within 30 m from a pond edge. Both species' thresholds converged between 500 and 1000 m at about 50{\%} forest cover. This study is flawed in that it estimates threshold values purely from pond-level occupancy. Pond activity may not be a great indicator of upland quality and upland activity. 

Wood frogs and spotted salamanders are great target species for my study because they are aquatic breeders with poor dispersal capacities that depend on forest habitat in non-breeding times
- red-backed salamanders will be good for the land-use history aspect 

Are critical thresholds useful?

Different species have different suitable habitat.},

abstract = {Eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus; RBS), known to be one of the most common vertebrates within its geographical range, is an amphibian species commonly used as indicator of forest ecosystem health. Its suitability in this role is based in part on previous studies showing that it is sensitive to changes in habitat such as increased acidity. The occurrence and body sizes of RBS were examined under coverboards, over a 5 y period, in a northern hardwood forest of Quebec (Canada) having a highly acidic forest floor (pH = 3.7 0.4). During this period, 565 RBS were captured. Encounter rate (29{\%})of salamanders under coverboards was considered very high, as compared to similar studies. Also, 87{\%} of youngs of the year and 83{\%} of adults were found under coverboards that had a forest floor pH 3.8, representing 79{\%} of all coverboards. Weight and length of RBS measured in this forest ecosystem are among the highest values reported in the scientific literature for this species. Both the relatively high body parameter values and occurrence of RBS in this acidic environment contradict previous studies that demonstrated the negative influence of soil pH on the occurrence and health of RBS. These observations indicate that a highly acidic habitat may support a healthy RBS population. Moreover, the studied forest seems to have the lowest pH yet reported for a habitat known to support this salamander species. Given that RBS has been widely used as an indicator for monitoring forest ecosystems in recent years, this new information on microhabitat tolerance should be considered for correctly using this species as indicator of forest health and soil acidity.},
annote = {One of several recent studies that have expanded on the acidity tolerance of Plethodon cinereus. In their site in Quebec (Canada), salamanders occupied highly acidic soil environments ({\textless} 3.8). This soil pH of this study region is the lowest documented for any P. cinerus population. They used coverboards to monitor salamanders over a period of five years. Counts declined throughout the period of study, likely due to repeated disturbance of the coverboards themselves. One problem with this study was the sampling design itself. Coverboards were mostly distributed in acidic soils (likely due to constraints of the study site soil variability), with few boards in plots {\textgreater} 4.0 pH. One plausible reason for acidic tolerance in this region is intraspecific geographical variation - species tolerances may not be uniform across its entire distribution. A single species can display spatial heterogeneity in adaptations, such as acid tolerance. While an acidic environment may support P. cinereus populations in this forest in Quebec, the same might not be true for populations elsewhere. No significant relationships were observed between abundance, length, and weight of salamanders and pH in this study. This investigation should be approached as a site-specific case study of acid tolerance in a plethodontid salmamander.},

abstract = {In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi- species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others. Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example 'sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified frame- work needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differ- ences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded tbat they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.

abstract = {''Cumulative impact,'' the incremental effect of an impact added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future impacts, was reviewed as it pertains to southern forested wetlands. In the U.S., the largest losses of forested wetlands between the 1970s and 1980s occurred in southeastern states that had the most bottomland hardwood to begin with: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These losses were due primarily to forestry and agriculture. Other sources of cumulative impact include decrease in average area of individual wetlands, shift in proportion of wetland types, change in spatial configuration of wetlands, and loss of cumulative wetland function at the landscape scale. For two wetland-related functions, flood flow and loading of suspended solids, watersheds that contained less than 10{\%} wetlands were more sensitive to incremental loss of wetland area than were watersheds with more than 10{\%} wetlands. The relative position of wetlands within a drainage network also influenced their cumulative function. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are becoming an important tool for evaluating cumulative impacts and their effects.},

abstract = {Abstract We introduce the binomial N-mixture model, a hierarchical Poisson/binomial mixture model for joint estimation of abundance and false-negative measurement error. Replicated counts over a short time period, during which we must be able to assume closure (constant abundance at every site), permit separate estimation of abundance and detection probability. This is the canonical model for abundance with measurement error in this book. It can be extended in many ways—e.g., to include zero inflation, different abundance distributions such as negative binomial and Poisson-lognormal, many kinds of linear and nonlinear models for link-transformed abundance or detection parameters, and a wide variety of random effects to account for additional variation in abundance or detection or for dealing with correlation structures. We give many examples for both simulated and real-world data and fit the models using unmarked and BUGS. We also introduce a very general data simulation function for N-mixture models (simNmix) and use it to illustrate the investigation of N-mixture model study design, of effects of assumption violations, goodness of fit (GoF) testing, and the use of the N-mixture model in a time-for-space substitution setting. Conventional N-mixture models with Poisson abundance mixture frequently fail to achieve formal fit to real data sets when judged by GoF tests such as (bootstrapped) Chi-square. Adoption of negative binomial or Poisson-lognormal mixtures can often mitigate the fit problem, but may lead to unrealistically high abundance estimates. We cover GoF assessment and residual diagnostics for these models in some depth and suggest that for moderate amounts of lack of fit, a somewhat ad hoc overdispersion correction for the standard Poisson N-mixture model may give inferences that are more satisfactory. We also cover the important issue of unknown effective sampling area, which affects ∗all∗ abundance and distribution modeling other than spatial capture-recapture and distance sampling. We present some reasonable, but again somewhat ad hoc, methods to accommodate coverage bias and to adjust for effective sampling areas that may extend beyond the limits of a nominal sample area. This latter is typically due to the movement of individuals within home ranges at the edge of a sampling area (“sunflower effects”). Finally, we briefly cover three further N-mixture models—the Royle-Nichols (or Poisson/Bernoulli mixture), Poisson/Poisson, and multiscale N-mixture models. Some of the material in this chapter (especially that on GoF assessment and mitigation of lack of fit) is somewhat tentative; we emphasize that more research is needed in this area. We finish by making connections to other models, especially multinomial N-mixture models and dynamic N-mixture models, which are covered extensively in later parts of the book.},

abstract = {In isolated oceanic islands, colonization patterns are often interpreted as resulting from dispersal rather than vicariant events. Such inferences may not be appropriate when island associations change over time and new islands do not form in a simple linear trend. Further complexity in the phylogeography of ocean islands arises when dealing with endangered taxa as extinctions, uncertainty on the number of evolutionary 'units', and human activities can obscure the progression of colonization events. Here, we address these issues through a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of giant Gal{\'{a}}pagos tortoises, integrating DNA data from extinct and extant species with information on recent human activities and newly available geological data. Our results show that only three of the five extinct or nearly extinct species should be considered independent evolutionary units. Dispersal from mainland South America started at approximately 3.2 Ma after the emergence of the two oldest islands of San Cristobal and Espa{\~{n}}ola. Dispersal from older to younger islands began approximately 1.74 Ma and was followed by multiple colonizations from different sources within the archipelago. Vicariant events, spurred by island formation, coalescence, and separation, contributed to lineage diversifications on Pinz{\~{o}}n and Floreana dating from 1.26 and 0.85 Ma. This work provides an example of how to reconstruct the history of endangered taxa in spite of extinctions and human-mediated dispersal events and highlights the need to take into account both vicariance and dispersal when dealing with organisms from islands whose associations are not simply explained by a linear emergence model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Many species of wildlife depend on riparian habitats for various life-history functions (e.g., breeding, foraging, overwintering). Although this unique habitat is critical for many species, delineations of riparian zones and buffers for various taxa are lacking. Typically when buffer zones are determined to mitigate edge effects, they are based on criteria that protect aquatic resources alone and do not consider impacts to wildlife and other terrestrial resources. Using two different survey methods (area-constrained daytime searches and nighttime visual encounter searches), we estimated core terrestrial habitat and buffer widths for stream-breeding salamanders in southern Appalachian streams from May to August 2004. A core terrestrial habitat of 27.0 m encompassed 95{\%} of the salamander assemblage (four species of stream plethodontids), and an additional 50 m (to buffer edge effects) yielded a total buffer of 77.0 m. When each species of the assemblage was analyzed separately, the maximum core terrestrial habitat needed for the Blue Ridge two-lined salamander (Eurycea wilderae), a dominant member and the farthest-ranging species from the stream, was 42.6 m. Thus, we recommend an overall buffer width of 92.6 m in southern Appalachian streams. To protect stream amphibians and other wildlife dependent on riparian areas, land managers and policy makers must consider conserving more than aquatic resources alone. Developing core terrestrial habitat estimates and buffer zone widths for wildlife populations is a critical first step in the conservation of many semiaquatic organisms and protecting biodiversity.},
annote = {Crawford and Semlitsch argue for increasing core habitat zones/buffers for stream-breeding plethodontids to 92.6 m in this study of habitat use and abundance patterns. Salamanders display species-specific habitat preferences, but the majority will reside within 20 m of the stream edge. The authors illustrate the strong contrast in observations from daytime and nighttime surveys - nighttime transects yielded overall core habitat estimates that were more than double the daytime estimates (27 m vs 10.7 m). The authors conclude that daytime surveys alone are inadequate for estimating habitat requirements of salamanders. They also indicate that survey data were averaged over the six rounds in this study (distances that salamanders were found away from streams were averaged for each transect, across all rounds).

abstract = {Restoration of damaged ecosystems through invasive species removal and native species conservation is an increasingly common practice in biodiversity conservation. Estimating the degree of ecosystem response attributable specifically to eradication of exotic herbivores versus restoration of native herbivores is often difficult and is complicated by concurrent temporal changes in other factors, especially climate. We investigated the interactive impacts of native mega-herbivores (giant tortoises) and the eradication of large alien herbivores (goats) on vegetation productivity across the Galapagos Archipelago. We examined archipelago-wide patterns of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation productivity between 2001 and 2015 and evaluated how goat and historical and current tortoise occurrence influenced productivity. We used a breakpoint analysis to detect change in trends in productivity from five targeted areas following goat eradication. We found a positive association between tortoise occurrence and vegetation productivity and a negative association with goat occurrence. We also documented an increase in plant productivity following goat removal with recovery higher in moister regions than in arid region, potentially indicating an alternate stable state has been created in the latter. Climate variation also contributed to the detected improvement in productivity following goat eradication, sometimes obscuring the effect of eradication but more usually magnifying it by up to 300{\%}. Our work offers perspectives regarding the effectiveness and outcomes of eradicating introduced herbivores and re-introducing native herbivores, and the merits of staging them simultaneously in order to restore critical ecosystem processes such as vegetation productivity.},

abstract = {S-PLUS is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas which have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-PLUS to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S-PLUS and a course in modern statistical methods. S-PLUS is available for both Windows and UNIX workstations, and both versions are covered in depth. The aim of the book is to show how to use S-PLUS as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended for would-be users of S-PLUS and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis and pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout, modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing, and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This third edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although S-PLUS 3.3/4 are also considered. The major change from the second edition is coverage of the current versions of S-PLUS. The material has been extensively rewritten using new examples and the latest computationally intensive methods. The companion volume on S Programming will provide an in-depth guide for those writing software in the S language. The authors have written several software libraries that enhance S-PLUS; these and all the datasets used are available on the Internet in versions for Windows and UNIX.

abstract = {Birds respond rapidly to changes in both habitat and climate conditions and thus are good indicators of the ecological effects of a changing climate, which may include warmer temperatures, changing habitat conditions, and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme events like drought. We investigated how a widespread tree mortality event concurrent with a severe drought influenced the avian community of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. We assessed and compared the separate effects of climate stresses and altered habitat conditions on the avian community and used this information to evaluate the changes that are likely to occur in the near future. We built tree mortality maps from freely available Landsat imagery with Google Earth Engine. We analyzed avian point counts from 2010 to 2016 in the southern Sierra Nevada, to model temperature, water deficit, and tree mortality effects on the abundances of 45 bird species, and then used these models to project abundances into the future based on three climate projections. A large portion of the avian community, 47{\%}, had a positive relationship with temperature increase, compared to 20{\%} that responded negatively. More species (36{\%}) declined with drier conditions than increased (29{\%}). More species declined in response to high tree mortality (36{\%}) than increased (9{\%}). A preponderance of species adapted to colder temperatures (higher elevation) had negative responses to high tree mortality and water deficit, but positive responses to increasing temperature. We projected the highest total bird abundances in the future under the warmest climate scenario that we considered, but habitat modification (e.g., tree mortality) and water deficit could offset the positive influence of temperature for many species. As other studies have shown, climate warming may lead to substantial but idiosyncratic effects on wildlife species that could result in community composition shifts. We conclude that future climate conditions may not have a universally negative effect on biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada, but probable vegetation changes and increased likelihood of extreme events such as drought should be incorporated into climate-smart forest and wildlife management decisions.},

abstract = {In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this development further in the coming decades. These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P {\textless} 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P {\textless} 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a 'disturbance paradox', documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5{\%} (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6{\%}. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.},

abstract = {Current evolutionary models for amphibian life cycles reflect tradeoffs in size-specific growth and mortality rates between the aquatic and terrestrial stages. A limitation of these models is that they do not incorporate evolutionary phenomena that are associated with metapopulation structure. In this work I address components of the evolution of complex life cycles (CLCs) that are tied to the metapopulation dynamics of amphibians that use seasonal wetlands that vary in hydroperiod. In particular, I describe how selection for the minimum length of the larval period affects metapopulation viability and the selection/migration equilibrium. Selection to increase the minimum length of the larval period functionally reduces the number of viable breeding sites on the landscape, increases the average distance between neighboring sites, and increases the risk of metapopulation extinction. Within a metapopulation, asymmetric gene flow between populations that are adapted to different hydroperiods tends to swamp local selection for long larval periods at sites with long hydroperiods. The evolutionary stability of CLCs of many species with metapopulation structure may reflect the fact that extremely small metamorphs cannot survive on land, while lineages with long larval periods incur a high risk of metapopulation extinction. I encourage theorists to more carefully consider how life history traits and metapopulation viability are related for these and other taxa.},
annote = {Metapopulation organization is lost in landscapes supporting very high densities of ponds that are semipermanent or permanent. A balanced relationship: Low probability of small metamorph surviving on land to adulthood and high probability that selection for long larval periods results in short-term metapopulation extinction. Most CLC research has addressed how size and survival of metamorphs and juveniles are determined by growth and development rates of larvae. Petranka argues three reasons why complex life cycles are evolutionarily stable: (1) selection fluctuates and episodically favors larval stage over terrestrial stage, (2) antagonistic pleitropy b/w larval and post-metamorphic trait complexes results in balanced equilibrium, and (3) allometric constraints that progressively compromise feeding efiicientcy as tadpole grows. Several spatial factors can influence the evolution of life history traits and CLCs: selection, genetic drift, gene flow, metapopulation dynamics.},

Earlier in the 20th century, land cover was on a trajectory of forest expansion that followed agricultural abandonment. However, the potential for forest regeneration has slowed, and the extent of regional forest cover has declined by more than 4.0{\%}. Using remote-sensing data, statistical sampling, and change-detection methods, this research shows how land conversion varies spatially and temporally across the East from 1973–2000, and how those changes affect regional land-change dynamics. The analysis shows that agricultural land use has continued to decline, and that this enables forest recovery; however, an important land-cover transition has occurred, from a mode of regional forest-cover gain to one of forest-cover loss caused by timber cutting cycles, urbanization, and other land-use demands.},

abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.

abstract = {American chestnut trees once dominated vast areas of deciduous forest in eastern North America, but the exotic chestnut blight almost eliminated the species from the region. Introduction of blight-resistant American chestnut hybrids will probably start in the next decade after many years of tree breeding. What were the historic effects of chestnut on forest soils, and what changes may follow reintroduction of hybrid chestnuts? A site in southern Wisconsin provided an opportunity to examine the effect of chestnut trees on soil properties. At this site, 600 km northwest of chestnut's historic distribution, naturalized chestnuts have spread throughout an intact mixed-species forest from nine planted trees. The site contains soil developed on a silty loess-mantled ridge that abuts sandier hillslopes, allowing the effects of individual chestnuts to be examined on two soil types. I sampled and analyzed forest floor and mineral soils beneath canopies of individual American chestnuts and the surrounding mixed-species deciduous forest on fine-silt and sandy-loam soil types. On sandy loam soils, total soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), inorganic N and net mineralization and nitrification rates were 10-17{\%} higher beneath chestnut canopies compared to soils beneath mixed-species deciduous forest. The pool of total soil N beneath chestnut canopies was positively related to the silt content of the sandy loam soils. In contrast, there were no differences between properties of chestnut canopy and mixed-species deciduous forest soils on the fine silt texture class. On sandy loam soil conditions common throughout the pre-blight distribution of American chestnut, soil biogeochemical processes differ beneath individual chestnut trees relative to a diverse mixture of deciduous species. These findings suggest that widespread chestnut reintroduction has the potential to alter both stand- and watershed-scale processes.},

abstract = {Information on amphibian responses to fire and fuel reduction practices is critically needed due to potential declines of species and the prevalence of new, more intensive fire management practices in North American forests. The goals of this review are to summarize the known and potential effects of fire and fuels management on amphibians and their aquatic habitats, and to identify information gaps to help direct future scientific research. Amphibians as a group are taxonomically and ecologically diverse; in turn, responses to fire and associated habitat alteration are expected to vary widely among species and among geographic regions. Available data suggest that amphibian responses to fire are spatially and temporally variable and incompletely understood. Much of the limited research has addressed short-term (1-3 years) effects of prescribed fire on terrestrial life stages of amphibians in the southeastern United States. Information on the long-term negative effects of fire on amphibians and the importance of fire for maintaining amphibian communities is sparse for the majority of taxa in North America. Given the size and severity of recent wildland fires and the national effort to reduce fuels on federal lands, future studies are needed to examine the effects of these landscape disturbances on amphibians. We encourage studies to address population-level responses of amphibians to fire by examining how different life stages are affected by changes in aquatic, riparian, and upland habitats. Research designs need to be credible and provide information that is relevant for fire managers and those responsible for assessing the potential effects of various fuel reduction alternatives on rare, sensitive, and endangered amphibian species. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Rehabilitation and restoration of forest ecosystems are in growing demand to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and desertification-major environmental problems of our time. Interest in restoration of ecosystems is increasingly translated into strong political commitment to large-scale tree planting projects. Along with this new impetus and the enormous scale of planned projects come both opportunities and risks: opportunities to significantly increase the use of native species, and risks of failure associated with the use of inadequate or mismatched reproductive material, which though it may provide forest cover in the short term, will not likely establish a self-sustaining ecosystem. The value of using native tree species in ecosystem restoration is receiving growing recognition both among restoration practitioners and policy makers. However, insufficient attention has been given to genetic variation within and among native tree species, their life histories and the consequences of their interactions with each other and with their environment. Also restoration practitioners have often neglected to build in safeguards against the anticipated effects of anthropogenic climate change. Measurement of restoration success has tended to be assessments of hectares covered or seedling survival in a short timeframe, neither of which is an indicator of ecosystem establishment in the long term. In this article, we review current practices in ecosystem restoration using native tree species, with a particular focus on genetic considerations. Our discussion is organised across three themes: (i) species selection and the sourcing of forest reproductive material; (ii) increasing resilience by fostering natural selection, ecological connectivity and species associations; and (iii) measuring the success of restoration activities. We present a number of practical recommendations for researchers, policymakers and restoration practitioners to increase the potential for successful interventions. We recommend the development and adoption of decision-support tools for: (i) collecting and propagating germplasm in a way that ensures a broad genetic base of restored tree populations, including planning the sourcing of propagation material of desired species well before the intended planting time; (ii) matching species and provenances to restoration sites based on current and future site conditions, predicted or known patterns of variation in adaptive traits and availability of seed sources; and (iii) landscape-level planning in restoration projects.},

abstract = {Harvesting timber is a common form of land use that has the potential to cause declines in amphibian populations. It is essential to understand the behavior and fate of individuals and the resulting consequences for vital rates (birth, death, immigration, emigration) under different forest management conditions. We report on experimental studies conducted in three regions of the United States to identify mechanisms of responses by pond-breeding amphibians to timber harvest treatments. Our studies demonstrate that life stages related to oviposition and larval performance in the aquatic stage are sometimes affected positively by clearcutting, whereas effects on juvenile and adult terrestrial stages are mostly negative. Partial harvest treatments produced both positive and weaker negative responses than clearcut treatments. Mitigating the detrimental effects of canopy removal, higher surface temperature, and loss of soil-litter moisture in terrestrial habitats surrounding breeding ponds is critical to maintaining viable amphibian populations in managed forested landscapes.},

         {\textless}p{\textgreater}We examine features of citizen science that influence data quality, inferential power, and usefulness in ecology. Background context includes ecological sampling (probability‐based, purposive, opportunistic), linkage between sampling technique and statistical inference (design‐based, model‐based), and scientific paradigms (confirmatory, exploratory). We distinguish several types of investigations, from intensive research with rigorous protocols targeting clearly articulated questions to mass‐participation internet‐based projects with opportunistic data collection lacking sampling design, and examine overarching objectives, design, analysis, volunteer training and performance. Projects with strong designs, expertise and training of volunteers, and professional oversight are well suited for ecological research objectives, and can produce high‐quality data with strong inferential power. Projects with little or no sampling design and minimal volunteer training are better suited for general objectives related to public education or data exploration, as reliable statistical estimation can be difficult or impossible. In some cases, statistically robust analytical methods and/or external data may increase the inferential power of certain opportunistically collected data. Ecological management, especially by government agencies, frequently requires data suitable for reliable inference. Citizen science can potentially make valuable contributions to conservation by increasing the scope of species monitoring efforts with standardized protocols, state‐of‐the‐art analytical methodology, and well‐supervised programs. Data quality can be improved by adhering to basic principles of data collection and analysis, designing studies to ensure the data quality required, and including necessary statistical expertise, thereby strengthening the “science” aspect of citizen science and enhancing acceptance by the scientific community and decision makers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

abstract = {The articles in this special feature challenge the presumption that scholars can make simple, predictive models of social-ecological systems (SESs) and deduce universal solutions, panaceas, to problems of overuse or destruction of resources. Moving beyond panaceas to develop cumulative capacities to diagnose the problems and potentialities of linked SESs requires serious study of complex, multivariable, nonlinear, cross-scale, and changing systems. Many variables have been identified by researchers as affecting the patterns of interactions and outcomes observed in empirical studies of SESs. A step toward developing a diagnostic method is taken by organizing these variables in a nested, multitier framework. The framework enables scholars to organize analyses of how attributes of (i) a resource system (e.g., fishery, lake, grazing area), (ii) the resource units generated by that system (e.g., fish, water, fodder), (iii) the users of that system, and (iv) the governance system jointly affect and are indirectly affected by interactions and resulting outcomes achieved at a particular time and place. The framework also enables us to organize how these attributes may affect and be affected by larger socioeconomic, political, and ecological settings in which they are embedded, as well as smaller ones. The framework is intended to be a step toward building a strong interdisciplinary science of complex, multilevel systems that will enable future diagnosticians to match governance arrangements to specific problems embedded in a social-ecological context.},

abstract = {Research Impact Statement: Seasonal wetlands are connected biologically to surrounding ecosystems through the movements of animals. This connectivity is critical to species conservation and ecosystem functioning. ABSTRACT: Many species that inhabit seasonally ponded wetlands also rely on surrounding upland habitats and nearby aquatic ecosystems for resources to support life stages and to maintain viable populations. Understanding biological connectivity among these habitats is critical to ensure that landscapes are protected at appropriate scales to conserve species and ecosystem function. Biological connectivity occurs across a range of spatial and temporal scales. For example, at annual time scales many organisms move between seasonal wetlands and adjacent terrestrial habitats as they undergo life-stage transitions; at generational time scales, individuals may disperse among nearby wetlands; and at multigenerational scales, there can be gene flow across large portions of a species' range. The scale of biological connectivity may also vary among species. Larger bod-ied or more vagile species can connect a matrix of seasonally ponded wetlands, streams, lakes, and surrounding terrestrial habitats on a seasonal or annual basis. Measuring biological connectivity at different spatial and temporal scales remains a challenge. Here we review environmental and biological factors that drive biological con-nectivity, discuss implications of biological connectivity for animal populations and ecosystem processes, and provide examples illustrating the range of spatial and temporal scales across which biological connectivity occurs in seasonal wetlands.

Current trends point to continued human population growth and ever higher levels of consumption as the global economy expands. This will stress the capacity of agriculture to meet food needs without further sacrificing the environmental integrity of local landscapes and the global environment. Agriculture's main challenge for the coming decades will be to produce sufficient food and fiber for a growing global population at an acceptable environmental cost. This challenge requires an ecological approach to agriculture that is largely missing from current management and research portfolios. Crop and livestock production systems must be managed as ecosystems, with management decisions fully informed of environmental costs and benefits. Currently, too little is known about important ecological interactions in major agricultural systems and landscapes and about the economic value of the ecosystem services associated with agriculture. To create agricultural landscapes that are managed for multiple services in addition to food and fiber will require integrative research, both ecological and socioeconomic, as well as policy innovation and public education. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {In a laboratory study, we examined growth and survival of the caddisfly, Lepidostoma unicolor, feeding on two types of native leaf litter (Alnus rhombifolia [Alder] and a Salicaceae mix [Salix spp. and Populus fremontii]) and two invasive, non-native species (Tamarix ramosissima [saltcedar] and Arundo donax [giant reed]). Larval survival was high ({\textgreater} 85{\%}), and did not differ, among those fed Alnus, Salicaceae, or Tamarix litter, but was much lower (20{\%}) for larvae fed Arundo litter. Mean dry biomass of larvae fed Tamarix was 45{\%} greater than that of larvae fed Alnus, and both were significantly greater than the biomasses of insects fed Salicaceae or Arundo. Although both Alnus and Tamarix increased in percent nitrogen with conditioning, Alnus had a significantly higher nitrogen content (4.9 and 3.6{\%}, respectively). Final C : N-values for Alnus and Tamarix were below 18, while C : N for Arundo and Salicaceae were 56 and 44, respectively. Greater growth of larvae fed Tamarix is likely due to the high nutritive value of the conditioned litter, whereas conditioning of Arundo litter did not result in improved nutritive values. Larvae in the Alnus and Salicaceae treatments fed on the entire surface of the leaves until only the skeletons remained. In contrast, larvae in the Arundo treatments focused feeding activity along the margins and the torn portions of the blades. The low nutritional quality of Arundo and the high quality, but ephemeral nature of Tamarix litter potentially have negative effects on stream invertebrate production owing to the quality and duration of availability of leaf litter, as compared with native riparian vegetation.},

Unfortunately, researchers commonly use concepts of statistical inference whose foundations are distant from the problem of treatment choice. It has been particularly common to use hypothesis tests to compare treatments. Wald's development of statistical decision theory provides a coherent frequentist framework for use of sample data on treatment response to make treatment decisions. A body of recent research applies statistical decision theory to characterize uniformly satisfactory treatment choices, in the sense of maximum loss relative to optimal decisions (also known as maximum regret). This article describes the basic ideas and findings, which provide an appealing practical alternative to use of hypothesis tests. For simplicity, the article focuses on medical treatment with evidence from classical randomized clinical trials. The ideas apply generally, encompassing use of observational data and treatment choice in nonmedical contexts. ARTICLE HISTORY},

We discuss how the recent extinctions of endemic giant Cylindraspis tortoises on the Mascarene Islands have left a legacy of ecosystem dysfunction threatening the remnants of native biota, focusing on the island of Mauritius because this is where most has been inferred about plant-tortoise interactions. There is a pressing need to restore and preserve several Mauritian habitats and plant communities that suffer from ecosystem dysfunction. We discuss ongoing restoration efforts on the Mauritian offshore Round Island, which provide a case study highlighting how tortoise substitutes are being used in an experimental and hypothesis-driven conservation and restoration project. The immediate conservation concern was to prevent the extinction and further degradation of Round Island's threatened flora and fauna. In the long term, the introduction of tortoises to Round Island will lead to valuable management and restoration insights for subsequent larger-scale mainland restoration projects. This case study further highlights the feasibility, versatility and low-risk nature of using tortoises in restoration programs, with particular reference to their introduction to island ecosystems. Overall, the use of extant tortoises as replacements for extinct ones is a good example of how conservation and restoration biology concepts applied at a smaller scale can be microcosms for more grandiose schemes and addresses more immediate conservation priorities than large-scale ecosystem rewilding projects. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract = {Replication is complicated in psychological research because studies of a given psychological phenomenon can never be direct or exact replications of one another, and thus effect sizes vary from one study of the phenomenon to the next--an issue of clear importance for replication. Current large scale replication projects represent an important step forward for assessing replicability, but provide only limited information because they have thus far been designed in a manner such that heterogeneity either cannot be assessed or is intended to be eliminated. Consequently, the non-trivial degree of heterogeneity found in these projects represents a lower bound on heterogeneity. We recommend enriching large scale replication projects going forward by em- bracing heterogeneity. We argue this is key for assessing replicability: if effect sizes are sufficiently heterogeneous--even if the sign of the effect is consistent--the phenomenon in question does not seem particularly replicable and the theory underlying it seems poorly constructed and in need of enrichment. Uncovering why and revising theory in light of it will lead to improved theory that explains heterogeneity and in- creases replicability. Given this, large scale replication projects can play an important role not only in assessing replicability but also in advancing theory.},

abstract = {Starting in the late 1970s, ecologists began unraveling the role of recently extinct large vertebrates in evolutionary ecology and ecosystem dynamics. Three decades later, practitioners are now considering the role of ecological history in conservation practice, and some have called for restoring missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential using taxon substitutes - extant, functionally similar taxa - to replace extinct species. This pro-active approach to biodiversity conservation has proved controversial. Yet, rewilding with taxon substitutes, or ecological analogues, is now being integrated into conservation and restoration programmes around the world. Empirical evidence is emerging that illustrates how taxon substitutions can restore missing ecological functions and evolutionary potential. However, a major roadblock to a broader evaluation and application of taxon substitution is the lack of practical guidelines within which they should be conducted. While the International Union for Conservation of Nature's reintroduction guidelines are an obvious choice, they are unsuitable in their current form. We recommend necessary amendments to these guidelines to explicitly address taxon substitutions. A second impediment to empirical evaluations of rewilding with taxon substitutions is the sheer scale of some proposed projects; the majority involves large mammals over large areas. We present and discuss evidence that large and giant tortoises (family Testudinidae) are a useful model to rapidly provide empirical assessments of the use of taxon substitutes on a comparatively smaller scale. Worldwide, at least 36 species of large and giant tortoises went extinct since the late Pleistocene, leaving 32 extant species. We examine the latent conservation potential, benefits, and risks of using tortoise taxon substitutes as a strategy for restoring dysfunctional ecosystems. We highlight how, especially on islands, conservation practitioners are starting to employ extant large tortoises in ecosystems to replace extinct tortoises that once played keystone roles. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

Preservation of habitat fragments may not be sufficient to maintain natural diversity in streams, and maintenance of such biodiversity may require conservation of much or all of the watershed.},

One way is to identify 'biodiversity hotspots' where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. As many as 44{\%} of all species of vascular plants and 35{\%} of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4{\%} of the land surface of the Earth. This opens the way for a 'silver bullet' strategy on the part of conservation planners, focusing on these hotspots in proportion to their share of the world's species at risk.},

abstract = {Many species of vertebrates require multiple habitats to obtain di erent resources at different stages of their life-cycles. Use of habitat mosaics takes place on a variety of spatial and temporal scales, from a daily requirement for adjacent habitats to seasonal use of geographically separated environments. Mosaics of habitats are also required in some species to allow ontogenetic habitat shifts, while in others each sex may have speciﬁc requirements that are met by different habitats. The extent and nature of animal movements are key (but generally poorly known) factors affecting the vulnerability of species to landscape change. The requirement by many species for multiple habitats suggests that their conservation will be most e ective in a mosaic environment and that protection of certain high proﬁle habitats alone, such as rainforest, will be insu cient to achieve conservation goals. Management regimes that result in homogenization of habitats should be avoided. Priority should be given to research that identiﬁes the extent to which species can locate habitat mosaics, at different spatial scales and arrangements, in modiﬁed environments.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. SUMMARY. Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

abstract = {In western Europe, forest area has been expanding rapidly since the 19th century, mainly on former agricultural land. Previous studies show that plant diversity differs between these recent forests and ancient forests that were already forested at the time of first national cadastral surveys, around 1800. Here, we investigated the duration of such agricultural aftereffects. In northeastern France, large areas were deforested during the Roman occupation and thereafter abandoned to forest. In one such forest that was farmed during the period AD 50–250, we show that species richness and plant communities vary according to the intensity of former agriculture. These variations are linked to long-term changes of chemical and structural soil properties. Hence, we suggest that such effects of past agricultural land use on forest biodiversity may be irreversible on an historical time scale.},
annote = {Land use legacies on a former northeastern French abbey were investigated in this study. Long term ecological impacts were observed across a gradient of land use intensity. Higher levels of soil phosphorus, carbon, nitrogen, and pH, were recorded with increasing land use intensity. Areas that were plowed exhibited higher soil water-holding capacities. Vegetation communities also differed depending on the historical land use, likely due to persistent alterations of the soil environment. Areas that had more intense historical disturbances also had higher levels of soil nutrients and consequently more ruderal species.

In this article we present an overview ofthe global permafrost C pool iUiii of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere, as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high-latitude inventory estimates, with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastropliically, exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be nltered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species composition, and ecosystem energy exchange. However, these processes do not appear to be able to compensate for C release from thawing permafrost, making it likely that the net effect of widespread permafrost thawing will be a positive feedback to a warming climate.},

abstract = {Aim: This study evaluates the long-term history of grassland, heathland and shrubland communities that are high priorities for conservation in the north-eastern US and support numerous globally rare species. Such an historical perspective is necessary in order to develop appropriate conservation and management approaches for these communities. Location: The study area encompasses the coastal region that extends from Cape Cod, MA to Long Island, NY, including the islands of Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and Block Island. Methods: In order to determine whether open-land habitats occurred in the study region prior to European arrival in the seventeenth century and to assess changes to these communities through the historical period, a wide range of palaeoecological, archaeological, ethno-historical, biological and field data were reviewed. Information about the history of human impacts on these communities was used to interpret landscape change over time and to evaluate current and potential conservation and management approaches. Results: The region was predominantly wooded prior to widespread Euro-American land clearing beginning in the seventeenth century, with some areas of early successional habitats, primarily on exposed sites and near Native American settlements. Grasslands, heathlands and shrublands increased dramatically as a result of intensive and primarily agricultural disturbance through the historical period. The decline in recent decades of these communities results from extensive residential and commercial development, and from widespread abandonment of traditional agricultural practices, especially intensive grazing. Main conclusions: Despite considerable uncertainty as to the pre-European distribution and abundance of species characteristic of grasslands, heathlands and shrublands, historical disturbances have been sufficiently widespread and severe that it is unlikely that modern species assemblages closely resemble those that occurred prior to European arrival. Management aimed at perpetuating early successional species assemblages on sites other than exposed, coastal locations may require use of traditional land-use practices or appropriate substitutes of comparable intensity.},

abstract = {Despite their generally isolated geographic locations, the freshwaters of the north are subjected to a wide spectrum of environmental stressors. High-latitude regions are especially sensitive to the effects of recent climatic warming, which have already resulted in marked regime shifts in the biological communities of many Arctic lakes and ponds. Important drivers of these limnological changes have included changes in the amount and duration of snow and ice cover, and, for rivers and lakes in their deltas, the frequency and extent of spring floods. Other important climate-related shifts include alterations in evaporation and precipitation ratios, marked changes in the quality and quantity of lake and river water inflows due to accelerated glacier and permafrost melting, and declining percentages of precipitation that falls as snow. The depletion of stratospheric ozone over the north, together with the clarity of many Arctic lakes, renders them especially susceptible to damage from ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants, coupled with the focusing effects of contaminant transport from biological vectors to some local ecosystems (e.g., salmon nursery lakes, ponds draining seabird colonies) and biomagnification in long food chains, have led to elevated concentrations of many persistent organic pollutants (e.g., insecticides, which have never been used in Arctic regions) and other pollutants (e.g., mercury). Rapid development of gas and oil pipelines, mining for diamonds and metals, increases in human populations, and the development of all-season roads, seaports, and hydroelectric dams will stress northern aquatic ecosystems. The cumulative effects of these stresses will be far more serious than those caused by changing climate alone.},

abstract = {The framework for analyzing sustainability of social-ecological systems (SES) framework of Elinor Ostrom is a multitier collection of concepts and variables that have proven to be relevant for understanding outcomes in diverse SES. The first tier of this framework includes the concepts resource system (RS) and resource units (RU), which are then further characterized through lower tier variables such as clarity of system boundaries and mobility. The long-term goal of framework development is to derive conclusions about which combinations of variables explain outcomes across diverse types of SES. This will only be possible if the concepts and variables of the framework can be made operational unambiguously for the different types of SES, which, however, remains a challenge. Reasons for this are that case studies examine other types of RS than those for which the framework has been developed or consider RS for which different actors obtain different kinds of RU. We explore these difficulties and relate them to antecedent work on common-pool resources and public goods. We propose a diagnostic procedure which resolves some of these difficulties by establishing a sequence of questions that facilitate the step-wise and unambiguous application of the SES framework to a given case. The questions relate to the actors benefiting from the SES, the collective goods involved in the generation of those benefits, and the action situations in which the collective goods are provided and appropriated. We illustrate the diagnostic procedure for four case studies in the context of irrigated agriculture in New Mexico, common property meadows in the Swiss Alps, recreational fishery in Germany, and energy regions in Austria. We conclude that the current SES framework has limitations when applied to complex, multiuse SES, because it does not sufficiently capture the actor interdependencies introduced through RS and RU characteristics and dynamics.},

abstract = {Introduction Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) is a dominant tree species in the cold temperate mixed forest zone in eastern Eurasia. Its seeds are food sources for wildlife but have become an important and marketable part of the economy for local communities. Methods We conducted ecological surveys inside and around Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve (CMNR) each year following the legalization of pine seed harvesting in 2000-2005 and restrictions on pine seed harvesting in 2006-2009. Results We found that human harvesting of pine cones was associated with declines in pine seed production and quality, pine regeneration, and populations of Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), sable (Martes zibellina), and Siberian weasel (Mustela sibirica). Discussion CMNR generally harbored greater wildlife populations than were found outside of its boundaries, but populations inside and outside of CMNR tended to decline in response to unrestricted cone harvesting. Enactment of restrictions on harvesting of cones in 2006 led to rebounds in populations of squirrel, sable, weasel, yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula) and Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) in CMNR relative to outside, concurrent with a reduced percent of seed being usurped by humans. However, harvest restrictions failed to diminish damage to trees by humans or seeds by insect pests, and regeneration of pine did not rebound. Conclusion Our findings suggest that wildlife declines are reversible in the short-term, but long-term forest ecosystem stability is likely only if pine seed harvesting is either stopped or dramatically reduced on a permanent basis within CMNR.},

abstract = {Fractionation of carbon isotopes by plants during CO2 uptake and fixation ($\Delta$leaf) varies with environmental conditions, but quantitative patterns of $\Delta$leaf across environmental gradients at the global scale are lacking. This impedes interpretation of variability in ancient terrestrial organic matter, which encodes climatic and ecological signals. To address this problem, we converted 3,310 published leaf $\delta$13C values into mean $\Delta$leaf values for 334 woody plant species at 105 locations (yielding 570 species-site combinations) representing a wide range of environmental conditions. Our analyses reveal a strong positive correlation between $\Delta$leaf and mean annual precipitation (MAP; R2 = 0.55), mirroring global trends in gross primary production and indicating stomatal constraints on leaf gas-exchange, mediated by water supply, are the dominant control of $\Delta$leaf at large spatial scales. Independent of MAP,we show a lesser, negative effect of altitude on $\Delta$leaf and minor effects of temperature and latitude. After accounting for these factors, mean $\Delta$leaf of evergreen gymnosperms is lower (by 1-2.7{\%}) than for other woody plant functional types (PFT), likely due to greater leaf-level water-use efficiency. Together, environmental and PFT effects contribute to differences in mean $\Delta$leaf of up to 6{\%} between biomes. Coupling geologic indicators of ancient precipitation and PFT (or biome) with modern $\Delta$leaf patterns has potential to yield more robust reconstructions of atmospheric $\delta$13C values, leading to better constraints on past greenhouse-gas perturbations. Accordingly, we estimate a 4.6{\%} decline in the $\delta$13C of atmospheric CO2 at the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, an abrupt global warming event ∼55.8 Ma.},

As a result, a new criterion of practical benefit is recommended for evaluating research findings about the effectiveness of interventions in complex organizations where benchmarks of existing performance exist. Practical benefit exists when the unadjusted performance of an experimental group provides a noticeable advantage over an existing benchmark. Some basic principles for determining practical benefit are provided. Practical benefit is more intuitive and is expected to enable leaders to make more accurate assessments as to whether published research findings are likely to produce noticeable improvements in their organizations. In addition, practical benefit is used routinely as the research criterion for the alternative scientific methodology of improvement science that has an established track record of being a more efficient way to develop new interventions that improve practice dramatically than RCT research. Finally, the problems with practical significance suggest that the research community should seek different inferential methods for research designed to improve clinical performance in complex organizations, as compared to methods for testing theories and medicines.

abstract = {Aim: We explore the relationship between current European distributions of amphibian and reptile species and observed climate, and project species potential distributions into the future. Potential impacts of climate warming are assessed by quantifying the magnitude and direction of modelled distributional shifts for every species. In particular we ask, first, what proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to lose and gain suitable climate space in the future? Secondly, do species projections vary according to taxonomic, spatial or environmental properties? And thirdly, what climate factors might be driving projections of loss or gain in suitable environments for species? Location: Europe. Methods: Distributions of species are modelled with four species-climate envelope techniques (artificial neural networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and classification tree analyses) and distributions are projected into the future using five climate-change scenarios for 2050. Future projections are made considering two extreme assumptions: species have unlimited dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A novel hybrid approach for combining ensembles of forecasts is then used to group linearly covarying projections into clusters with reduced inter-model variability. Results: We show that a great proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to expand distributions if dispersal is unlimited. This is because warming in the cooler northern ranges of species creates new opportunities for colonization. If species are unable to disperse, then most species are projected to lose range. Loss of suitable climate space for species is projected to occur mainly in the south-west of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula, whilst species in the south-east are projected to gain suitable climate. This is because dry conditions in the south-west are projected to increase, approaching the levels found in North Africa, where few amphibian species are able to persist. Main conclusions: The impact of increasing temperatures on amphibian and reptile species may be less deleterious than previously postulated; indeed, climate cooling would be more deleterious for the persistence of amphibian and reptile species than warming. The ability of species to cope with climate warming may, however, be offset by projected decreases in the availability of water. This should be particularly true for amphibians. Limited dispersal ability may further increase the vulnerability of amphibians and reptiles to changes in climate. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Empirical research in streams has demonstrated that terrestrial subsidies of tree leaf litter influence multiple community factors including composition, diversity and growth of individuals. However, little research has examined the importance of tree litter species on wetlands, which are ubiquitous across the landscape and serve as important habitats for a unique and diverse community of organisms. Using outdoor mesocosms, we assessed the impact of 12 litter monocultures and three litter mixtures (from both broadleaf and conifer trees) on pond communities containing gray tree frog tadpoles Hyla versicolor, periphyton, phytoplankton and zooplankton. We found that leaf litter species had substantial and differential impacts on all trophic groups in the community including effects on algal abundance, zooplankton density and amphibian growth. In many instances, patterns of responses were specific to individual litter species yet some responses, including both pH values and periphyton biomass, were generalizable to broad taxonomic groups. In addition, while most responses of litter mixtures were additive, we found evidence for antagonistic effects of litter mixing among responses of periphyton and amphibian body mass. Our results highlight the potential impact of human and naturally driven changes in forest composition on wetland communities through associated changes in leaf litter.},

abstract = {The exchange of organisms and energy among ecosystems has major impacts on food web structure and dynamics, yet little is known about how climate warming combines with other pervasive anthropogenic perturbations to affect such exchanges. We used an outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment to investigate the interactive effects of warming, eutrophication, and changes in top predators on the flux of biomass between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We demonstrated that predatory fish decoupled aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by reducing the emergence of aquatic organisms and suppressing the decomposition of terrestrial plant detritus. In contrast, warming and nutrients enhanced cross-ecosystem exchanges by increasing emergence and decomposition, and these effects were strongest in the absence of predators. Furthermore, we found that warming advanced while predators delayed the phenology of insect emergence. Our results demonstrate that anthropogenic perturbations may extend well beyond ecosystem boundaries by influencing cross-ecosystem subsidies. We find that these changes are sufficient to substantially impact recipient communities and potentially alter the carbon balance between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Two forms of long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory synaptic transmission have been identified in the mammalian CNS, which are induced by the synaptic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, respectively. The mGlu receptor-dependent form of LTD can be activated by application of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a group I selective mGlu receptor agonist. DHPG-induced LTD is increasingly being used to investigate the mechanisms of mGlu receptor-dependent LTD. However, recent experiments have argued for both a pre- and postsynaptic locus of expression of DHPG-induced LTD. In the present study we report that DHPG-induced LTD is not associated with changes in the sensitivity of CA1 neurons to bath applied AMPA. Furthermore, in contrast to homosynaptic LTD, DHPG-induced LTD is also not associated with changes in sensitivity to focally uncaged L-glutamate. These data do not support the notion that DHPG-induced LTD requires a modification of AMPA receptors, such as their internalisation, but are compatible with a presynaptic mechanism of expression.},

abstract = {The forest restoration challenge (globally 2. billion. ha) and the prospect of changing climate with increasing frequency of extreme events argues for approaching restoration from a functional and landscape perspective. Because the practice of restoration utilizes many techniques common to silviculture, no clear line separates ordinary forestry practices from restoration. The distinction may be that extra-ordinary activities are required in the face of degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems. Restoration is driven by the desire to increase sustainability of ecosystems and their services and restoration is likely to have multiple goals arising from the motivations of those involved. The process of setting restoration objectives translates vague goals into feasible, measurable targets and ultimately actions on the ground. Our objective for this review is to synthesize the science underpinning contemporary approaches to forest restoration practice. We focus on methods and present them within a coherent terminology of four restoration strategies: rehabilitation, reconstruction, reclamation, and replacement. While not a consensus terminology, these terms have a logical foundation. Rehabilitation restores desired species composition, structure, or processes to a degraded ecosystem. Reconstruction restores native plant communities on land recently in other resource uses, such as agriculture. Reclamation restores severely degraded land generally devoid of vegetation, often the result of resource extraction, such as mining. Replacement of species (or their locally-adapted genotypes) with new species (or new genotypes) is a response to climate change. Restoration methods are presented as available tools; because adding vegetation is an effective restoration technique, the discussion of methods begins with a description of available plant materials. We then discuss altering composition under different initial overstory conditions, including deployment methods depending upon whether or not an overstory is present, how much of the landscape will be restored, and the complexity of the planting design. We present some major approaches for altering structure in degraded forest stands, and describe approaches for restoration of two key ecosystem processes, fire and flooding. Although we consider stand-level designs, what we describe is mostly scalable to the landscape-level. No restoration project is undertaken in a social vacuum; even stand-level restoration occurs within a system of governance that regulates relationships among key agents. Gathering information and understanding the social dimensions of a restoration project is as necessary as understanding the biophysical dimensions. Social considerations can trump biophysical factors.},

abstract = {The Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands harbor some of the least impacted marine ecosystems in the tropics, but there are indications that local artisanal fishing is affecting exploited marine communities. To quantify these effects, I sampled communities of fishes and sea urchins at a number of heavily fished and lightly fished sites throughout the central islands of the archipelago. Sites were selected based on information collected as part of a local fisheries monitoring study and standardized across a number of abiotic factors. Abundance and biomass of the primary target species were significantly lower in the heavily fished sites than in the lightly fished sites. Community structure also differed between heavily and lightly fished sites. Cluster analyses of the full community of fishes and a subset of nontarget fishes revealed that sites within a treatment were more similar to one another than sites between treatments. Herbivorous fishes tended to be lower in abundance and sea urchins tended to be higher in abundance in heavily fished sites, but these differences were not significant. My results are encouraging in that the direct effects of artisanal fishing are limited to the primary target species, which probably results from a high specificity of fishing gear. The differences in community structure, however, suggest that artisanal fishing also has cascading effects on noncommercial species throughout the community. An improved understanding of important ecological interactions, increased ecological and fishery monitoring, and effective precautionary management are needed to ensure that human effects in these waters remain minimal.},

A survey of 304 vernal pools in southern, central, and northern Maine, USA was conducted to assess pool physical characteristics, landscape setting, and presence of pool-breeding amphibians for the purpose of guiding potential pool conservation strategies. In particular, information on reproductive effort by pool-breeding amphibians was used to assess the statewide applicability of the Maine Natural Resources Protection Act's proposed definition of Significant Vernal Pool, a category of Significant Wildlife Habitats that allows closer environmental review of proposed impacts to vernal pools. The results of our study show regional differences in pool characteristics and amphibian usage. Defining "significance" based on number of egg masses and diversity of vernal pool indicator species is a useful tool but should be considered in the context of such landscape characteristics as availability of suitable terrestrial habitat and distribution of other breeding habitats and wetlands.},

Effectively confronting declines requires a greater understanding of amphibian population dynamics, which is limited both by sampling and statistical techniques. Ascertaining population trends requires either a robust sampling design (i.e., mark-recapture) or a statistical strategy that accounts for detection.

abstract = {When replicate count data are overdispersed, it is common practice to incorporate this extra-Poisson variability by including latent parameters at the observation level. For example, the negative binomial and Poisson-lognormal (PLN) models are obtained by using gamma and lognormal latent parameters, respectively. Several recent publications have employed the deviance information criterion (DIC) to choose between these two models, with the deviance defined using the Poisson likelihood that is obtained from conditioning on these latent parameters. The results herein show that this use of DIC is inappropriate. Instead, DIC was seen to perform well if calculated using likelihood that was marginalized at the group level by integrating out the observation-level latent parameters. This group-level marginalization is explicit in the case of the negative binomial, but requires numerical integration for the PLN model. Similarly, DIC performed well to judge whether zero inflation was required when calculated using the group-marginalized form of the zero-inflated likelihood. In the context of comparing multilevel hierarchical models, the top-level DIC was obtained using likelihood that was further marginalized by additional integration over the group-level latent parameters, and the marginal densities of the models were calculated for the purpose of providing Bayes' factors. The computational viability and interpretability of these different measures is considered.},

abstract = {Pond-breeding amphibians have been characterized as having metapopulation structure, and a goal of many local restoration projects is to establish viable metapopulations. However, recent studies suggest that metapopulation organization is unlikely at the local level because of high dispersal rates between neighboring ponds. Although many amphibians avoid ovipositing in habitats that pose high predation risk to their offspring, the spatial scale of avoidance is poorly resolved for natural systems and could involve wholesale movements between ponds. To deter- mine the scale of avoidance, we monitored annual habitat use by the Wood frog (Rana sylvatica), American toad (Bufo americanus), and Spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) at a restoration site in western North Caroli- na, U.S.A. Wood frogs consistently used most fish-free ponds, but rapidly curtailed use following fish invasions. American toads rarely used the same breeding site from year to year, and adults strongly avoided ovipositing in hab- itats with predatory Wood frog tadpoles. Spotted salaman- ders exhibited a predator avoidance response to fish that was weaker than the predator avoidance response of anu- rans. Our data indicate that the spatial scale of predator avoidance by ovipositing amphibians often exceeds that of an individual pond and that the focal species at this site are organized as patchy populations rather than as meta- populations.At local restoration sites, ponds that are placed in spatial arrays to create metapopulations may not ac- complish their goal and may limit the extent to which ovi- positing adults can express an adaptive antipredator behavior. We discuss an alternative design that is more likely to enhance the long-term persistence of local populations.},

abstract = {Summary: Understanding space usage and resource selection is a primary focus of many studies of animal populations. Usually, such studies are based on location data obtained from telemetry, and resource selection functions (RSFs) are used for inference. Another important focus of wildlife research is estimation and modeling population size and density. Recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models accomplish this objective using individual encounter history data with auxiliary spatial information on location of capture. SCR models include encounter probability functions that are intuitively related to RSFs, but to date, no one has extended SCR models to allow for explicit inference about space usage and resource selection. In this paper we develop the first statistical framework for jointly modeling space usage, resource selection, and population density by integrating SCR data, such as from camera traps, mist-nets, or conventional catch traps, with resource selection data from telemetered individuals. We provide a framework for estimation based on marginal likelihood, wherein we estimate simultaneously the parameters of the SCR and RSF models. Our method leads to increases in precision for estimating parameters of ordinary SCR models. Importantly, we also find that SCR models alone can estimate parameters of RSFs and, as such, SCR methods can be used as the sole source for studying space-usage; however, precision will be higher when telemetry data are available. Finally, we find that SCR models using standard symmetric and stationary encounter probability models may not fully explain variation in encounter probability due to space usage, and therefore produce biased estimates of density when animal space usage is related to resource selection. Consequently, it is important that space usage be taken into consideration, if possible, in studies focused on estimating density using capture-recapture methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {We surveyed a streamside community in a southern Appalachian old-growth forest to determine the feasibility of using removal sampling to estimate salamander density and biomass. We removed salamanders during 21 nightly searches of two 30 × 30 m plots from 29 June to 20 July 1999. Despite the removal of 2433 animals and a lack of evidence for significant trespass onto plots, there was no overall decline in total catch per night. Moisture levels associated with recent rainfall history strongly influenced the surface activity of small species (Desmognathus carolinensis, Desmognathus wrighti, Eurycea bislineata wilderae) but not large species (Plethodon jordani, Plethodon glutinosus, Plethodon yonahlossee). More refined analyses of individual species using either regression analysis (large species) or covariance analysis (small species adjusted for moisture conditions) indicate that the catch of all species except D. wrighti declined with time. The estimated number of consecutive nights required to remove 70{\%} of the population varied from eight (P. yonahlossee) to 32 (D. carolinensis) and tended to be inversely related to the body size of the species. Conservative estimates of total salamander density and wet biomass in streamside habitats at this site are 18,486 individuals and 16.53 kg per hectare. These values are seven and 14 times greater than those reported for the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire and underscore the importance of salamanders in riparian zone communities of southern Appalachian forests.},

abstract = {In some agricultural regions, natural wetlands are scarce, and constructed agricultural ponds may represent important alternative breeding habitats for amphibians. Properly managed, these agricultural ponds may effectively increase the total amount of breeding habitat and help to sustain populations. We studied small, constructed agricultural ponds in southeastern Minnesota to assess their value as amphibian breeding sites. Our study examined habitat factors associated with amphibian reproduction at two spatial scales: the pond and the landscape surrounding the pond. We found that small agricultural ponds in southeastern Minnesota provided breeding habitat for at least 10 species of amphibians. Species richness and multispecies reproductive success were more closely associated with characteristics of the pond (water quality, vegetation, and predators) compared with characteristics of the surrounding landscape, but individual species were associated with both pond and landscape variables. Ponds surrounded by row crops had similar species richness and reproductive success compared with natural wetlands and ponds surrounded by nongrazed pasture. Ponds used for watering livestock had elevated concentrations of phosphorus, higher turbidity, and a trend toward reduced amphibian reproductive success. Species richness was highest in small ponds, ponds with lower total nitrogen concentrations, tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) present, and lacking fish. Multispecies reproductive success was best in ponds with lower total nitrogen concentrations, less emergent vegetation, and lacking fish. Habitat factors associated with higher reproductive success varied among individual species. We conclude that small, constructed farm ponds, properly managed, may help sustain amphibian populations in landscapes where natural wetland habitat is rare. We recommend management actions such as limiting livestock access to the pond to improve water quality, reducing nitrogen input, and avoiding the introduction of fish.},
annote = {Agricultural ponds across a range of aquatic and upland factors were sampled to identify habitat factors most associated with amphibian reproductive success in agricultural landscapes. The authors found greater overall support for aquatic factors in limiting breeding effort and larval recruitment. Constructed ponds may be nearly equivalent to natural ponds in their use by amphibians. Important aquatic factors limiting amphibian activity included pond area (negative relationship with species richness), nitrogen, fish presence, and vegetation cover. Surprisingly, a negative relationship was detected between vegetative cover and amphibian abundance - a result that may be confounded by biased detection probabilties in more densely vegetated ponds. Many interactions are species-species specific. The authors recommend an increase in small constructed ponds (with appropriate management buffers) in agricultural landscapes with low natural wetland densities.

"Pond factors more important than upland factors to amphibian community responses (species richness and reproductive success)."

Negative relationship between pond area and species richness

Suggesting best management practices for amphibian reproductive success should prescibe wetland habitat with low N concentrations, low amounts of vegetation, and no fish.

The vegetation results are questionable - dense vegetation may be confounded with fish presence and/or also create an observer detection bias - more vegetation lowers detection probabilities.},

abstract = {(1) Semi-arid savannas, wherever they occur, have generally been overgrazed and encroached on by bush. A model is developed which accounts for the growth of woody vegetation and of grasses, and analyses the competition between them for available soil water. (2) The model is based on Walter's two layer hypothesis. Woody vegetation and grasses compete for water in the surface layers of the soil, but woody vegetation has exclusive access to a source of water relatively deep underground. Where there is only a small biomass of grass the soil surface tends to become impermeable and, in these conditions, the model shows that two different steady states may develop: with a lot of woody vegetation alone, or with a relatively large biomass of grass and rather little woody vegetation. (3) The results are discussed in terms of the concept of resilience. The continued existence of both stable states under ranching conditions seems to depend on periodic heavy, or over-, grazing which allows for the maintenance of unpalatable or unstable grass species, which thus set a minimum to grass biomass--a minimum which cannot be reduced by herbivores. (4) Comparison of the dynamics of various savanna and other natural systems leads to the conclusion that the resilience of the systems decreases as their stability (usually induced) increases.},

A control group was fed and a treatment group was starved within a randomized block design. After each of three trials, amphibian tissues were analyzed for lipid, protein, and water content. Mean pretreatment wet weight and SMI of individuals of each species and body form, representing two populations of equal body condition, were similar between control and treatment groups. Starved animals, representing a population in poor condition, had a 17–32{\%} lower SMI than fed animals. Scaled fat and protein or lean mass were strongly correlated (r = 0.85–0.99) with SMI compared with percentages of fat, protein, or lean mass (r = 0.08– 0.60). The SMI accurately reflected amphibian energy stores, but the depletion of energy stores differed by species and body form, with tadpoles retaining fat and the other species and body forms depleting fat stores. In addition, factors that we controlled in the laboratory (e.g., hydration, gut fill, reproductive state) may alter mass-length relationships in the field, so we advise collecting some specimens for body composition analyses to ensure the accuracy of the SMI when used in other applications.},

abstract = {Understanding the relative impacts of predators on prey may improve the ability to predict the effects of predator composition changes on prey assemblages. We experimentally examined the relative impact of native and introduced predatory fish on a temporary wetland amphibian assemblage to determine whether these predators exert distinct (unique or non-substitutable) or equivalent (similar) impacts on prey. Predatory fish included the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), golden topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus), flagfish ( Jordanella floridae), and the introduced walking catfish ( Clarias batrachus). The tadpole assemblage included four common species known to co-occur in temporary wetlands in south-central Florida, USA: the oak toad (Bufo quercicus), pinewoods treefrog (Hyla femoralis), squirrel treefrog (Hyla squirella), and eastern narrowmouth toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis). Tadpoles were exposed to different predators in wading pools under conditions similar to those found in surrounding temporary wetlands (particularly in terms of substrate type, the degree of habitat complexity, and temperature). Native predators were similar with respect to predation rate and prey selectivity, suggesting similar energy requirements and foraging behavior. Conversely, native fish predators, especially G. holbrooki, were distinct from the introduced C. batrachus. In contrast to expectations, C. batrachus were less voracious predators than native fish, particularly G. holbrooki. Moreover, survival of G. carolinensis and H. femoralis were higher in the presence of C. batrachus than G. holbrooki. We suggest that C. batrachus was a less efficient predator than native fish because the foraging behavior of this species resulted in low predator-prey encounter rates, and thus predation rate. In combination with a related field study, our results suggest that native predatory fish play a stronger role than C. batrachus in influencing the spatial distribution and abundance of temporary wetland amphibians in the landscape.},

abstract = {Native biodiversity on the Galapagos Archipelago is severely threatened by invasive alien species. On Santa Cruz Island, the abundance of introduced plant species is low in the arid lowlands of the Galapagos National Park, but increases with elevation into unprotected humid highlands. Two common alien plant species, guava (Psidium guajava) and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) occur at higher elevations yet their seeds are dispersed into the lowlands by migrating Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.). Tortoises transport large quantities of seeds over long distances into environments in which they have little or no chance of germination and survival under current climate conditions. However, climate change is projected to modify environmental conditions on Galapagos with unknown consequences for the distribution of native and introduced biodiversity. We quantified seed dispersal of guava and passion fruit in tortoise dung piles and the distribution of adult plants along two elevation gradients on Santa Cruz to assess current levels of ‘wasted' seed dispersal. We computed species distribution models for both taxa under current and predicted future climate conditions. Assuming that tortoise migratory behaviour continues, current levels of “wasted” seed dispersal in lowlands were projected to decline dramatically in the future for guava but not for passion fruit. Tortoises will facilitate rapid range expansion for guava into lowland areas within the Galapagos National Park where this species is currently absent. Coupled with putative reduction in arid habitat for native species caused by climate change, tortoise driven guava invasion will pose a serious threat to local plant communities.},

We introduce the conditional and the full likelihood, and we discuss Bayesian analysis of these models in BUGS using the idea of data augmentation, which we discussed in Chapter 7. We then extend the basic ideas to the problem of hierarchical distance sampling (HDS), where we have multiple point or transect sample units in space (or possibly in time). The benefit of HDS in practice is that it allows us to directly model spatial variation in population size among these sample units. This is a preeminent concern of most field studies that use distance sampling methods, but it is not a problem that has received much attention in the literature. We show how to analyze HDS models in both the unmarked package and in the BUGS language for point and line transects, and for continuous and binned distance data. We provide a case study of HDS applied to a survey of the island scrub-jay on Santa Cruz Island, California.},

abstract = {Detectability of individual animals is highly variable and nearly always{\textless}1; imperfect detec- tion must be accounted for to reliably estimate population sizes and trends. Hierarchical models can simultaneously estimate abundance and effective detection probability, but there are several different mechanisms that cause variation in detectability. Neglecting tem- porary emigration can lead to biased population estimates because availability and condi- tional detection probability are confounded. In this study, we extend previous hierarchical binomialmixture models to account for multiple sources of variation in detectability. The state process of the hierarchical model describes ecological mechanisms that generate spatial and temporal patterns in abundance, while the observation model accounts for the imperfect nature of counting individuals due to temporary emigration and false absences. We illustrate our model's potential advantages, including the allowance of temporary emi- gration between sampling periods, with a case study of southern red-backed salamanders Plethodon serratus.We fit our model and a standard binomialmixture model to counts of terrestrial salamanders surveyed at 40 sites during 3–5 surveys each spring and fall 2010– 2012. Our models generated similar parameter estimates to standard binomial mixture models. Aspect was the best predictor of salamander abundance in our case study; abun- dance increased as aspect became more northeasterly. Increased time-since-rainfall strongly decreased salamander surface activity (i.e. availability for sampling), while higher amounts of woody cover objects and rocks increased conditional detection probability (i.e. probability of capture, given an animal is exposed to sampling). By explicitly accounting for both components of detectability, we increased congruence between our statistical model- ing and our ecological understanding of the system. We stress the importance of choosing survey locations and protocols that maximize species availability and conditional detection probability to increase population parameter estimate reliability.},

To effectively identify the local Twitter users for each county of the United States, we integrate three commonly used methods and develop a query approach in a high-performance computing environment.

At the same time, growing involvement with the market (even on a surplus basis, as distinct from commercial farming) probably gave farmers a different outlook on agricultural production. In particular, it may have led to a new determina- tion to control the composition of their food supply. Then, in turn, the wider variety of foods available throughout the year inspired new prefer- ences and expectations about the preparation and consumption of meals.},

We summarize changes that have been made to this framework and discuss a few remaining ambiguities in its formulation. Specifically, we offer a tentative rearrangement of the list of relevant attributes of governance systems and discuss other ways to make this framework applicable to policy settings beyond natural resource settings. The SES framework will continue to change as more researchers apply it to additional contexts; the main purpose of this article is to delineate the version that served as the basis for the theoretical innovations and empirical analyses detailed in other contributions to this special issue},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Global biodiversity loss has prompted diverse efforts to stem or reverse declines for many species. Such efforts are often implemented before the efficacy of alternative management actions is quantified. Here, we use matrix models to compare the effectiveness of two supplementation strategies, head-starting early life stages and captive breeding for reintroduction, at reducing extinction risk of declining amphibians. We use the imperiled Oregon spotted frog (Rana pretiosa) as a case study and find that when supplementation occurs after metamorphosis, captive breeding is more effective at reducing extinction risk than head-starting, but the difference declines with increasing supplementation effort. We also find that captive breeding with release as larvae yields similar reductions in extinction risk, and is two orders of magnitude more effective at reducing extinction probabilities than head-starting the same stage. Our results highlight that even basic demographic data can be leveraged to assess tradeoffs among alternative supplementation strategies.},

abstract = {Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be detected at a site when present. Recently a model has been developed that enables estimation of the proportion of area occupied, when the target species is not detected with certainty. Here we apply this modeling approach to data collected on terrestrial salamanders in the Plethodon glutinosus complex in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA, and wish to address the question "how accurately does the fitted model represent the data?" The goodness-of-fit of the model needs to be assessed in order to make accurate inferences. This article presents a method where a simple Pearson chi-square statistic is calculated and a parametric bootstrap procedure is used to determine whether the observed statistic is unusually large. We found evidence that the most global model considered provides a poor fit to the data, hence estimated an overdispersion factor to adjust model selection procedures and inflate standard errors. Two hypothetical datasets with known assumption violations are also analyzed, illustrating that the method may be used to guide researchers to making appropriate inferences. The results of a simulation study are presented to provide a broader view of the methods properties.},

abstract = {Non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire may help explain how pyrodiversity promotes biodiversity in fire-adapted systems. We built on previous research on avian responses to fire by investigating how complex effects of burn severity and time since fire influenced avian community composition across the northern Sierra Nevada, California. We conducted avian point counts from 2009 to 2015 in 10 fires that burned between 2000 and 2014, resulting in a chronosequence of 1–15 yr post-fire. We estimated the effects of burn severity, time since fire, non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire, pre-fire forest conditions, and several physiographic parameters on the density of 44 breeding bird species using hierarchical distance sampling models. In addition, we fit separate models to observations of each species in unburned forest to compare species' densities between burned and unburned forests. At least one of the non-linear or interaction fire effects was significant for 27 (61{\%}) of the 44 bird species. The quadratic effect of time since fire was an important predictor of post-fire densities of 20 species, illustrating the dynamic nature of this post-wildfire avian community. Greater maximum densities were estimated at some combination of burn severity and time since fire than in unburned forest for 13 of the 44 (30{\%}) species, only one of which reached maximum density following low-severity fire. In contrast, all of the 12 species that were more abundant in unburned forest reached maximum post-fire densities in fires that burned at low severity. Results from the study suggest that consideration of the non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire is important to fully understanding post-wildfire responses for a majority of birds. Moreover, the study supports a growing body of literature that indicates mixed-severity fire is essential for conserving avian diversity in many fire-maintained systems.},

abstract = {The northeastern United States is a predominately-forested region that, like most of the eastern U.S., has undergone a 400-year history of intense logging, land clearance for agriculture, and natural reforestation. This setting affords the opportunity to address a major ecological question: How similar are today's forests to those existing prior to European colonization? Working throughout a nine-state region spanning Maine to Pennsylvania, we assembled a comprehensive database of archival land-survey records describing the forests at the time of European colonization. We compared these records to modern forest inventory data and described: (1) the magnitude and attributes of forest compositional change, (2) the geography of change, and (3) the relationships between change and environmental factors and historical land use. We found that with few exceptions, notably the American chestnut, the same taxa that made up the pre-colonial forest still comprise the forest today, despite ample opportunities for species invasion and loss. Nonetheless, there have been dramatic shifts in the relative abundance of forest taxa. The magnitude of change is spatially clustered at local scales ({\textless}125 km) but exhibits little evidence of regional-scale gradients. Compositional change is most strongly associated with the historical extent of agricultural clearing. Throughout the region, there has been a broad ecological shift away from late successional taxa, such as beech and hemlock, in favor of early- and mid-successional taxa, such as red maple and poplar. Additionally, the modern forest composition is more homogeneous and less coupled to local climatic controls.},

abstract = {2016 was one of the warmest and driest summers on record throughout much of the Northeastern United States (Northeast). Additionally, historically low winter snowfall preceding the summer of 2016 exacerbated drought conditions and led to record low streamflows in some regions. Climate models suggest that short-term summer droughts could increase in frequency and continue to pose challenges to farmers and water resource managers in the Northeast. Here we focus on the impacts of the drought on farmers in New York State (NY), an economically important agricultural state in the Northeast. We found that in several regions across NY 2015-16 winter snowfall, and 2016 growing season precipitation and streamflows were near or below the 10th percentile of the previous 60 years; and 2016 air temperatures were near or above the 90th percentile of the previous 60 years. Based on survey results, more than 70{\%} of the 275 farmers surveyed across NY reported rainfed field crop and pasture yield losses greater than 30{\%}, with some loses over 90{\%}. In the hardest hit Western region of NY, substantial crop losses ({\textgreater}30{\%}) were reported for fruit and vegetable crops on farms with irrigation, due to limited irrigation equipment and water supplies (e.g. low streamflows, dry ponds or wells). After what they experienced in 2016, 32{\%} of the 75 farmers in follow-up interviews invested in irrigation equipment and water sources in 2016, and 32{\%} said they plan to do so in 2017. Thirty-two percent of farmers in follow-up interviews said they plan to take measures to improve soil health and soil organic matter to improve water holding capacity and better prepare for drought. Model estimates suggest NY state-wide crop irrigation water use could increase by 3–8 times in dry years compared to average growing seasons, increasing seasonal usage by millions of cubic meters. This highlights the potential for significant increases in water withdrawals in NY, with implications for water resources, particularly as the climate changes.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change will present both opportunities and challenges for pool-breeding amphibians. Increased water temperature and accelerated drying may directly affect larval growth, development, and survival, yet the combined effects of these processes on larvae with future climate change remain poorly understood. Increased surface temperatures are projected to warm water and decrease water inputs, leading to earlier and faster wetland drying. So it is often assumed that larvae will experience negative synergistic impacts with combined warming and drying. However, an alternative hypothesis is that warming-induced increases in metabolic rate and aquatic resource availability might compensate for faster drying rates, generating antagonistic larval responses. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the individual and interactive effects of pool permanency (permanent vs. temporary) and water temperature (ambient vs. (+) -3 degrees C) on three anurans with fast-to-slow larval development rates (Great Basin spadefoot [Spea intermontana], Pacific chorus frog [Pseudacris regilla], and northern red-legged frog [Rana aurora]). We found that although tadpoles in warmed pools reached metamorphosis 15-17 days earlier, they did so with little cost ({\textless} 2 mm) to size, likely due to greater periphyton growth in warmed pools easing drying-induced resource competition. Warming and drying combined to act antagonistically on early growth (P = 0.06) and survival (P = 0.06), meaning the combined impact was less than the sum of the individual impacts. Warming and drying acted additively on time to and size at metamorphosis. These nonsynergistic impacts may result from cotolerance of larvae to warming and drying, as well as warming helping to offset negative impacts of drying. Our results indicate that combined pool warming and drying may not always be harmful for larval amphibians. However, they also demonstrate that antagonistic responses are difficult to predict, which poses a challenge to proactive conservation and management. Our study highlights the importance of considering the nature of multiple stressor interactions as amphibians are exposed to an increasing number of anthropogenic threats.},

abstract = {Conservation needs for amphibians in managed timberlands may differ based upon the species present and the timber harvesting methods employed. Clearcuts have been documented to be detrimental to amphibians but the impacts of associated silvicultural edges and alternative harvesting treatments are not well understood. The primary objective of this study was to determine if amphibian abundances and body condition differed in thinned forests and intact forests, and in clearcuts and associated silvicultural edges. We also examined which environmental attributes were important in explaining observed differences. We sampled clearcuts, silvicultural edges, and adjacent late-seral forests at 10 sites in northwestern California from October 1999 to July 2002. Clearcuts at these sites ranged in age from 6 to 25 years. Five of these forest stands were intact and five had been commercially thinned at least 10 years prior to our study. Amphibian abundances were similar in thinned and unthinned forests, but body condition of the most common species was lower in thinned forests. Abundances of amphibians were nearly twice as high in forests and at silvicultural edges than in clearcuts. Clearcutting at these sites appears to have affected amphibian numbers up to 25 years post-harvest, however, silvicultural edges were suitable habitats for amphibians. While commercial thinning did not reduce amphibian numbers, it is an intermediate treatment followed by clearcutting. Where conservation of amphibians is a concern, even-aged silvicultural systems may not provide the most appropriate method for maintaining viable populations on managed forestlands in the northwestern US. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Terrestrial salamander abundance in North American forests is closely associated with forest characteristics, and salamander populations typically decline following timber removal. However, salamander responses to timber harvest vary considerably from one study to the next - some studies have shown limited or no effects whereas others have found harvest-related declines of up to 95{\%}. To estimate overall effect sizes of timber harvest on salamander populations and to examine factors that contribute to variation in salamander responses to harvest, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of the effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial salamander abundance. Based on 108 salamander species/treatment combinations from 24 studies, we found mean harvest-related declines ranged from 29{\%} (95{\%} CI = -2{\%} to 51{\%}) for long-term responses to partial canopy removal to 62{\%} (95{\%} CI = 29{\%} to 80{\%}) for short-term responses to clearcutting. Multivariate mixed models suggested that clearcutting had a modestly greater impact on salamander populations than partial harvest and that decreases following harvest were more pronounced at sites with warmer summer high temperatures. In addition, active sampling of salamanders (e.g., surface counts) led to greater apparent effects of timber harvest than passive sampling (e.g., cover boards or pitfall traps), suggesting that sampling methodology influenced the perceived effects of harvest. In the studies evaluated, salamander numbers almost always declined following timber removal, but salamanders were never extirpated and populations typically increased as forests regenerated. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Phenolic compounds in particular are a common plant defense, and these compounds may have disproportionate impacts on amphibians compared to other taxa. We coupled an exploration of invasive plant extract effects on larvae of four amphibian species (the salamander Ambystoma maculatum, the toad Anaxyrus americanus, and the frogs Hyla sp. and Lithobates blairi) with behavioral observations designed to determine whether behavior can ameliorate the negative effects of exposure to invasive plant extracts. Larvae were reared in extracts of the widespread invasive Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), mixed native leaf litter, and a water control. Anaxyrus americanus tadpoles reared in L. maackii extracts were more likely to die than tadpoles reared in native extracts, but differences in mortality following rearing in native and exotic extracts were not significant for the other three species. Anaxyrus americanus and L. blairi tadpoles made more trips to the surface in L. maackii extracts than in native extracts, consistent with the hypothesis that exotic extracts may interfere with respiratory physiology and suggesting that L. blairi can behaviorally ameliorate the negative effects of L. maackii extracts. Our study highlights both a direct and indirect pathway by which invasive plant extracts may alter the ecological dynamics of native fauna.},

abstract = {Neotropical cloud forests extend from 23°N to 25°S. In the north (Mexico) they are isolated and surrounded by xeric vegetation; in the south (Chile and Argentina) they grade into temperate rain forests. Elevationally, typical (modal) cloud forest is generally found between 1000-3000 m. Lower montane cloud forests (1000-2000 m) are characterized by a high percentage of epiphytes, ferns, and tropical taxa such as Annonaceae, Melastomataceae, palms, and Cyclanthaceae. Upper montane forests differ in the presence of such distinctly temperate-climate taxa as Podocarpus, Alnus, Drimys, Weinmannia, and Magnoliaceae. The geographic distribution patterns of Neotropical cloud forest taxa have been strongly influenced by the Pliocene reconnection between North and South America, which has permitted extensive reciprocal migrations of Andean taxa (eg Drimys) north and cordilleran taxa (eg Juglans) south. Endemism in cloud forest taxa is low at the generic level but high at the species level, suggesting recent and rapid speciation. -from Author},

abstract = {Recent field trials on blight-resistant hybrids (BC3F3) of American chestnut (Castanea dentata) and Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima) have intensified planning for widespread restoration of Castanea to eastern U.S. forests. Restoration will likely rely on natural seed dispersal from sites planted with chestnut; however, we do not know how dispersal agents such as granivorous rodents will respond to hybrid chestnuts. At one extreme, excessive seed consumption may impede restoration. Alternatively, scatter-hoarding rodents might facilitate the spread of chestnut by dispersal of seeds from restoration plantings. We conducted trials with five rodent species to quantify foraging preferences and to evaluate the potential role of granivores in chestnut restoration. Specifically, we presented seeds from American and hybrid chestnuts (BC3F2) with other common mast species and recorded the proportion of seeds removed and the fates of tagged seeds. Mice, chipmunks, and flying squirrels harvested both chestnut types preferentially over larger, tougher black walnut, hickory, and red oak seeds, but fox squirrels and eastern gray squirrels preferred larger seeds to chestnuts. All rodents consumed a greater proportion of the chestnuts than other seed types. American and hybrid chestnut also differed in important ways: except for fox squirrels, rodents preferentially removed American chestnuts over hybrid chestnuts, but we estimated that fox squirrels carried a greater proportion of hybrid chestnuts beyond our tag search area, suggesting that hybrids may be dispersed farther and cached more often than American chestnut. These differences indicate that hybrid chestnut may not be functionally equivalent to American chestnut with regard to seed-granivore interactions.},

abstract = {In the southeastern U.S., changes in temperature and precipitation over the last three decades have been the most dramatic in winter and spring seasons. Continuation of these trends could negatively impact pond-breeding amphib- ians, especially those that rely onwinter and spring rains to fill seasonal wetlands, trigger breeding, and ensure reproductive success. From 2009 to 2012, we monitored Spring and Fall presence of aquatic stages (larval and paedomorphic, gilled adult) of a winter-breeding amphibian (the mole salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum) and used multi-season models to estimate occupancy, local colonization and extinction. Seasonal estimates of occupancy, corrected for imperfect de- tection, declined from22.3{\%}of ponds in Spring 2009 to 9.9{\%} in Fall 2012. Our best supportedmodel suggested that changes in occupancy were driven by increased rates of extinction that corresponded with drought-related drying of ponds. Based on uncertainty in climate change projections for the Southeast, we present a conceptual model of predicted changes in wetland hydroperiods across a landscape with projected decreases and increases in future precipitation. Such precipitation changes could alter wetland hydroperiods, facilitate extinctions of spe- cies adapted to short, intermediate or long hydroperiod environ- ments and, ultimately, modify the composition of amphibian communities within freshwater wetland ecosystems.},

abstract = {Temporary streams and rivers support biodiversity and provide valuable goods and services, especially in arid and semi-arid landscapes. However, temporary streams and rivers are being degraded at alarming rates owing to development, hydromorphological alteration, and disposal of waste water, among other stressors, and pressure will likely increase under global change. Here we propose that it is key to manage temporary streams and rivers as a unique ecohydrological type and not as a permanent waterway or a terrestrial ecosystem. Nevertheless, two challenges hinder this goal. First, data availability on intermittent low regimes and associated biotas is currently scarce. As a consequence, flow-ecology relationships in temporary waterways are largely unknown, and appropriate metrics to define and monitor their ecological status are missing. Second, the ecological and social values of temporary streams and rivers are often underestimated, being regarded as secondary ecosystems relative to permanent waterways. To conserve temporary streams and rivers, ecologists need to define them as unique ecosystems and conservation targets, and practitioners need to systematically collect biological and hydrological data in these ecosystems. Innovative approaches at the intersection of ecology, citizen science, and management, can also contribute to their management and conservation by: i) mapping them, ii) informing people about their ecological values, iii) safeguarding them from further human threats, iv) preserving their flow regime when managing reservoirs, wastewater treatment plants, and water abstraction activities, and v) restoring physically-degraded temporary reaches (e.g. due to gravel mining and off-road use) or reaches that have lost historical flows due to increasing drought severity, diversions, and groundwater overuse.},

abstract = {In New England, temporary pool-breeding salamanders inhabit terrestrial forested habitats for the majority of the year. Wetland regulations and forestry Best Management Practices rarely consider the upland areas surrounding breeding pools for protection. Those that do, generally establish buffer zones that are insufficient to protect salamander populations. A better understanding of the area requirements and upland habitat preferences of pool-breeding salamanders is needed to develop biologically relevant buffers for conservation. I used radiotelemetry to investigate the postbreeding emigration and terrestrial habitat use of two syntopic mole salamander species. Sixteen adult salamanders (eight Ambystoma jeffersonianum, and eight Ambystoma maculatum) were radiotracked for a mean of 164 days (SE = 5.1). Eleven individuals were tracked to overwintering sites (five A. jeffersonianum, and six A. maculatum). Emigration distances from breeding pool edge varied widely (range = 30-219 m) with a mean of 112.8 m (SE = 19.9) for both species combined. Combining data from this and other studies, a salamander "life zone" that would encompass 95{\%} of the population was calculated, resulting in an area extending 175 m from a pool's edge. Two types of small mammal burrows (deep vertical tunnels, and highly branched horizontal tunnels) were used almost exclusively as terrestrial refuges. In general, Jefferson and Spotted Salamanders used well-shaded, deciduous forest stands with abundant logs and stumps. Their habitat use also showed a strong association with vertical mammal tunnels, suggesting that this resource may be limiting. Biologically defined salamander life zones should be identified as critical wildlife habitat and considered in forest management strategies.

annote = {Radiotelemetry study in Vermont to measure postbreeding habitat preferences of adult mole salamanders. Sixteen individuals were tracked and their locations were recorded throughout the study. Thorough habitat sampling was conducted at each salamander location. The researchers inventoried cover characteristics, topography, soil quality, and presence and length of mammal tunnels at the salamander locations. Salamander locations were associated with greater deciduous leaf litter, understory shrub cover, log and stump density, soil moisture, slope, and number of vertical tunnels. Larger spotted salamanders were associated with further dispersal movements. This study was unique in its attention to fine details of habitat use, including pit/mound structures and small mammal tunnels. Mole salamanders occupied mammal tunnels 95.3{\%} of the time, which may highlight their low detection rates in typical VES surveys that do not heavily scrutinize tunnels. Pits and mounds both provide habitat for salamanders through different mechanisms. Pits accumulate deep leaf litter and provide habitat for short-tailed shrews, which build tunnels very suitable for salamanders. Mounds are limiting in leaf litter but contain numerous tunnels, and thus may also provide beneficial habitat. The authors found an association between salamander locations and pit/mound systems, but did not identify which was actually driving that relationship. The authors recommend a 175 m core salamander "life zone", which is slightly larger than Semlitsch's 164 m recommendation.

Biologically defined salamander life zones

This study recommends a 175 m core habitat zone (11 m wider than Semlitsch's recommendation, using his data to update Semlitsch's calculations)

Salamander habitat is correlated with habitat of small burrowing mammals (well-shaded, deciduous forest stands with abundant logs and stumps) - so, might be more effective to manage habitat for small burrowing mammals 

The majority of ambystomatids are likely occupying burrows and a much smaller proportion are going to be found under logs

Key characteristics for ambystomatids: "mature, deciduous forest stands with low ambient light levels, well-developed layers of deciduous leaf litter, abundance CWD, dense low shrub layers, and relatively high soil moisture content"

Larger spotted salamanders (mass) may move larger distances than smaller spotted salamanders

Random thought - has anyone tested whether salamanders, particularly mole salamanders, are more limited by forest habtiat characteristics or the availability of tunnels specifically (like, testing whether salamanders will use coniferous habitat with artificial tunnels)},

abstract = {We investigated the response of Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae), the spring salamander, to timber harvest in headwater streams in New Hampshire (U.S.A.). We conducted cover-controlled, whole-stream surveys for G. porphyriticus in 25 first-order streams in drainages encompassing a range of timber-harvest histories. Streams in two different landscape configurations were chosen, isolated, or paired, based on the presence or absence of a confluent first-order stream-a potential source of immigrants. The analyzed salamander abundance with respect to logging history, presence of the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), salamander population connectivity, and other measures of physical habitat and aquatic conditions. In stepwise multiple-regression analysis, the best multivariate model of G. porphyriticus abundance included fish presence/absence; effect category, a combined junction of years since harvest and substrate embeddedness by fine sediment; and landscape configuration. These three factors explained 74{\%} of the variation in G. porphyriticus abundance. G. porphyriticus was less abundant in streams where fish were present, likely because of predation by S. fontinalis or asymmetric competition between these species. Abundance also declined with increasing substrate embeddedness and/or decreasing years since harvest, indicating an effect of fine sediment inputs and harvest history on this species. Finally, G. porphyriticus was less abundant in isolated streams than in paired streams, This result suggests that landscape-scale population connectivity may buffer this species from the negative effects of local (i.e., stream-scale) habitat perturbation. We hope this work will encourage others to develop multiscale models of land-use effects on stream biota and thereby ultimately increase the range and effectiveness of conservation strategies for these species.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that projections by alternative models can be so variable as to compromise their usefulness for guiding policy decisions. Here, we advocate the use of multiple models within an ensemble forecasting framework and describe alternative approaches to the analysis of bioclimatic ensembles, including bounding box, consensus and probabilistic techniques. We argue that, although improved accuracy can be delivered through the traditional tasks of trying to build better models with improved data, more robust forecasts can also be achieved if ensemble forecasts are produced and analysed appropriately. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Wetlands in the remote mountains of the western US have undergone two massive ecological "experiments" spanning the 20th century. Beginning in the late 1800s and expanding after World War II, fish and wildlife managers intentionally introduced millions of predatory trout (primarily Oncorhynchus spp) into fishless mountain ponds and lakes across the western states. These new top predators, which now occupy 95{\%} of large mountain lakes, have limited the habitat distributions of native frogs, salamanders, and wetland invertebrates to smaller, more ephemeral ponds where trout do not survive. Now a second "experiment" - anthropogenic climate change - threatens to eliminate many of these ephemeral habitats and shorten wetland hydroperiods. Caught between climate-induced habitat loss and predation from introduced fish, native mountain lake fauna of the western US - especially amphibians - are at risk of extirpation. Targeted fish removals, guided by models of how wetlands will change under future climate scenarios, provide innovative strategies for restoring resilience of wetland ecosystems to climate change. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Background: Random forests (RF) have been increasingly used in applications such as genome-wide association and microarray studies where predictor correlation is frequently observed. Recent works on permutation-based variable importance measures (VIMs) used in RF have come to apparently contradictory conclusions. We present an extended simulation study to synthesize results.Results: In the case when both predictor correlation was present and predictors were associated with the outcome (HA), the unconditional RF VIM attributed a higher share of importance to correlated predictors, while under the null hypothesis that no predictors are associated with the outcome (H0) the unconditional RF VIM was unbiased. Conditional VIMs showed a decrease in VIM values for correlated predictors versus the unconditional VIMs under HAand was unbiased under H0. Scaled VIMs were clearly biased under HAand H0.Conclusions: Unconditional unscaled VIMs are a computationally tractable choice for large datasets and are unbiased under the null hypothesis. Whether the observed increased VIMs for correlated predictors may be considered a "bias" - because they do not directly reflect the coefficients in the generating model - or if it is a beneficial attribute of these VIMs is dependent on the application. For example, in genetic association studies, where correlation between markers may help to localize the functionally relevant variant, the increased importance of correlated predictors may be an advantage. On the other hand, we show examples where this increased importance may result in spurious signals. {\textcopyright} 2010 Nicodemus et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Over millennia human well-being has benefited from ecosystems, not only through tangible goods, but also through intangible assets known as cultural ecosystem services. Despite growing research over the last decade, cultural services assessment still remains arbitrary and is largely limited to marketable services such as tourism. Evident difficulties in standardizing definitions and measurements have challenged cultural services accounting in decision making processes. However, the imminent formation of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services offers an opportunity to counterbalance this misrepresentation by establishing a scientific basis for consistently assessing cultural services. In that regard, the current review intends to facilitate discussion investigating the current state of cultural services accounting by offering an appraisal of existing evidence regarding cultural services indicator quality. The review builds on scientifically recognized frameworks to develop a holistic understanding of how cultural services indicators are conceived within ecosystem services research. Among the measures found, benefit indicators were most frequently used for assessing inspirational, educational and recreational services. A broad variety of methods for accounting cultural services was found, mainly due to the varied aims of the studies. Most of the cultural services indicators were deficient concerning their clarity of definitions, purposes and understanding of the processes to be measured and referring only marginally to tradeoffs and bundles with other services. Only 17{\%} performed multitemporal assessments and 23{\%} used spatially explicit information. It seems that indicator quality could be greatly enhanced by investing more effort toward involving relevant stakeholders in conceptualization and communication phases, using participatory mapping tools to enhance visibility. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

To assess this issue, we examined temporal change in the morphology of the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus), a small, abundant woodland salamander distributed widely in eastern North America with two distinct morphotypes: striped individuals associated with cooler microclimates and unstriped individuals associated with warmer microclimates. We compiled morph frequencies for 50,960 individual salamanders from 558 sites as recorded in the published literature and in unpublished field notes of herpetologists between 1908 and 2004. We observed that striping probability increased with increasing latitude, longitude, and elevation and decreased (from 80{\%} to 74{\%} range wide) with time. The combined forces of regional climate warming and, particularly, forest disturbance have evidently been sufficient to cause morphological evolution in this amphibian over the last century. {\textcopyright}2006 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Broad-scale forested wetland hydrology has been difficult to study with conventional remote sensing methods. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a new and rapidly developing technology. LiDAR data have mainly been used to derive information on elevation. However, the intensity (amplitude) of the signal has the potential to significantly improve the ability to remotely monitor inundation - an important component of wetland hydrology. A comparison between LiDAR intensity data collected during peak hydrologic expression and detailed in situ data from a series of forested wetlands on the eastern shore of Maryland demonstrate the strong potential of LiDAR intensity data for this application 96{\%} overall accuracy). The relative ability of LiDAR intensity data for forest inundation mapping was compared with that of a false color near-infrared aerial photograph collected coincident with the LiDAR intensity (70{\%} overall accuracy; currently the most commonly used method for wetland mapping) and a wetness index map derived from a digital elevation model. The potential of LiDAR intensity data is strong for addressing issues related to the regulatory status of wetlands and measuring the delivery of ecosystem services.},

Salamanders preferred deciduous leaves over coniferous pine needles and the deciduous soil/deciduous leaf litter combination over all others.

Decision makers have recognized that the legacies of land-use activities continue to influence ecosystems, particularly aquatic ones, for decades or centuries. The main objectives of this paper are to develop land use legacy maps to (1) assess historical and future (predicted) shifts in dominant land use classes (urban, agriculture, forest) in the Ohio River Basin (ORB), and (2) determine the past and future location of catchments in the ORB exceeding critical land use thresholds (10{\%} and 38{\%} urban and agricultural use of catchment respectively) for water quality and other aquatic resources. Our land use legacy simulations show that approximately 80{\%} of the ORB has remained as agriculture ({\~{}}37{\%}), forest ({\~{}}34{\%}), urban ({\~{}}7{\%}) and other classes ({\~{}}2{\%}) from 1930 to 1990. Within the remainder of landscape, agriculture to forest ({\~{}}16{\%}) and agriculture to urban ({\~{}}1.5{\%}) transitions were the most common land use changes between 1930 and 1990. Our forecast model shows that approximately 94{\%} of the ORB will remain as forest ({\~{}}47.46{\%}), agriculture ({\~{}}35.77{\%}), urban ({\~{}}8.84{\%}) and other classes ({\~{}}2.07{\%}) between 2000 and 2050. 1.44{\%} and 1.37{\%} of the ORB is predicted to transition from forest to urban and agriculture to urban between 2000 and 2050, respectively. Our results also demonstrate that 13{\%} and 74{\%} of the catchments in the ORB already exceeded critical urban and agricultural land use thresholds in 1930, respectively. We predict that 37{\%} of catchments in the ORB will have exceeded critical urban land use thresholds by 2050, whereas the proportion of catchments to exceed critical agricultural use will decrease to 45{\%}.},

abstract = {The pervasive impact of historical land use is often underappreciated in the management and restoration of conservation areas and natural resources. We used historical and ecological approaches to determine the relative influences of past land use, fire, and site conditions on woodland vegetation patterns in Cape Cod National Seashore (CACO), the largest protected coastal landscape and area of sand-plain vegetation in New England. Coastal sand plains are the focus of intense conservation activity because they support uncommon plant and animal assemblages that are dynamic as a result of past disturbance and ongoing human impacts. CACO was predominantly wooded prior to extensive land clearance for historical agriculture. Historical maps and modern soil profiles indicate that by the mid-19th century, 44{\%} of the area supporting sand-plain woodlands in CACO was plowed for crops or pasture, 42{\%} was logged repeatedly but never cleared, and 14{\%} was open and subjected to diverse uses. Relationships between modern vegetation and 19th-century land use are striking and largely independent of site conditions. Continuously wooded areas support pine–oak woodlands with abundant ericaceous shrubs, whereas previously plowed sites have less canopy oak, more pine, few ericaceous shrubs, and a distinct understory including the grass Deschampsia flexuosa and the shade-intolerant shrub Arctostaphylos uva-ursi. Current composition and historical sources suggest that past agriculture generated extensive heathland and grassland habitats, much of which has subsequently reforested. In contrast to many interpretations and management guidelines, the persistent influence of fire is principally on the canopy composition and structure of former woodlots. The results highlight a need (1) to integrate an understanding of past land use into ecological models underlying the management of biological reserves; and (2) to consider the use of management approaches that mimic past agricultural practices in order to maintain and restore important sand-plain habitats.

abstract = {Terrestrial plant litter is an important subsidy to freshwater ecosystems, where it serves as a basal resource in benthic food webs. Litter quantity and decomposition rate strongly influence energy flow through these food webs. Litter quantity often increases following nonnative plant invasions, but the impact this additional litter has on aquatic consumers is largely unknown. We conducted an experiment in outdoor microcosms containing plant litter, microbes, algae, and tadpoles. Many tadpoles feed on biofilms (bacteria, fungi, and algae) that develop during decomposition; as such, they are ideal organisms to test bottom-up effects of litter subsidies. We used a related pair of native and nonnative wetland grasses to investigate whether litter quantity affects tadpole performance. Tadpole performance metrics (developmental stage, size, and survival) showed significant positive responses to increased litter quantity but were mostly unaffected by plant species. Therefore, litter quantity was the primary determinant of tadpole performance in our experimental community. We suggest that changes to litter quantity can have important impacts on larval amphibians. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.},

This study found similar water chemistry between the two species, likely explaining the similar effect on tadpole performance.

Land use history is well known at this site. Adjacent forest stands of different ages and other vegetation patches were sampled in 1998-99 and in 2006. Out of the 12 species three (Eisenoides loennbergi, Bimastos palustris, Diplocardia caroliniana) were native, the rest were European peregrine earthworms. Native species were mainly found in mature forests, otherwise the species composition of mature and successional stands was similar. Earthworm density and biomass was significantly higher in the successional forests, than in the mature forests, and this pattern appears to be stable at a decadal time scale. Two smaller stands that have never been clearcut did not harbor any earthworms. The forest floor on these sites had a thick organic layer, moder humus and low pH. Bulk density was highest in the youngest (50-70 years) forests. It appears that as the forests enter to a late successional stage (150 years), they no longer can support high abundance of litter feeding earthworms. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Background and objectives We investigated various tumor markers in patients with surgically treated small cell lung cancer (SCLC) to identify the markers closely correlated to pathological staging and to predict survival by retrospective analyses. Methods Reviewing database records between 1990 and 2007 revealed 36 patients with SCLC, that were grouped according to clinical and pathological stages. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for serum levels of various tumor makers to predict the pathological stage. The cut-off value was calculated from the ROC curve of the significant marker. Survival in patient groups divided by the new cut-off value was calculated. Results Serum levels of various tumor makers were not significantly different between the pathological stage groups, except for serum sialyl Lewis X (SLX). ROC curve of SLX was significantly correlated to pathological stages (P=0.0136). The calculated SLX cut-off value was 25.1U/ml, with 80{\%} sensitivity and 70{\%} specificity. Five-year survival of patients selected by this new cut-off was 82.5{\%}, whereas that with the standard cut-off (38.0U/ml) was 55.9{\%}. Conclusions Serum SLX values were associated with pathological stage and survival after surgery in SCLC patients. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Nature-based recreation substantially benefits human wellbeing, for example, by improving physical and mental health. However, recreation can also have severe ecological impacts. The recreational value of landscapes and natural areas is often used to generate support for public spending in conservation. However, we still don't know whether nature-based recreationists place greater recreational value on natural areas that have high conservation value compared to other green spaces. Here, we determine which attributes of nature-based tourism provide recreational services. We used pictures of wildlife posted on Flickr to quantify wildlife watching activities in Scotland. We then determined the environmental variables key to attracting wildlife watchers to a destination, such as protected areas (PAs), the perceived naturalness, and the presence of different types of infrastructure. Infrastructure best predicts the intensity of wildlife watching activities in Scotland, while areas of high natural value are rarely used. PAs are weak attractors of wildlife watchers, with PAs designated to protect threatened habitats or species having low recreational value. In accessible and highly visited areas, higher biodiversity increases the intensity of wildlife watching activities. Synthesis and applications. Areas of high natural and conservation value and areas of high recreational value do not tend to overlap. Recreational ecosystem services are mainly provided by the wider countryside and highly transformed landscapes, as opposed to wild ecosystems and protected areas designated to protect environmental features of high conservation value. These results question the synergy between the goals of recreation and those of conservation and the use of recreation as a justification for economic investment in conservation. During wildlife watching activities most people experience an urbanised, highly transformed nature; it is important to determine how this human-dominated nature can influence support for conservation of wild and remote areas.},

abstract = {Social media data is increasingly used as a proxy for human activity in different environments, including protected areas, where collecting visitor information is often laborious and expensive, but important for management and marketing. Here, we compared data from Instagram, Twitter and Flickr, and assessed systematically how park popularity and temporal visitor counts derived from social media data perform against high-precision visitor statistics in 56 national parks in Finland and South Africa in 2014. We show that social media activity is highly associated with park popularity, and social media-based monthly visitation patterns match relatively well with the official visitor counts. However, there were considerable differences between platforms as Instagram clearly outperformed Twitter and Flickr. Furthermore, we show that social media data tend to perform better in more visited parks, and should always be used with caution. Based on stakeholder discussions we identified potential reasons why social media data and visitor statistics might not match: the geography and profile of the park, the visitor profile, and sudden events. Overall the results are encouraging in broader terms: Over 60{\%} of the national parks globally have Twitter or Instagram activity, which could potentially inform global nature conservation.},

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18{\%}) than mid-range ( approximately 24{\%}) and maximum-change ( approximately 35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Breeding adults and metamorphosing larval amphibians transfer energy between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems during seasonal migrations and emergences, although rarely has this been quantified. We intensively sampled ambystomatid salamander assemblages (Ambystoma opacum,A. maculatum, and A. tigrinum) in five forested ponds in southern Illinois to quantify energy flow associated with egg deposition, larval production, and emergence of metamorphosed larvae. Oviposition by female salamanders added 7.0-761.4 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM) year(-1) to ponds (up to 5.5 g AFDM m(-2) year(-1)). Larval production ranged from 0.4 to 7.4 g AFDM m(-2) year(-1) among populations in three ponds that did not dry during larval development, with as much as 7.9 g AFDM m(-2) year(-1) produced by an entire assemblage. Mean larval biomass during cohort production intervals in these three ponds ranged from 0.1 to 2.3 g AFDM m(-2) and annual P/B (production/biomass) ranged from 4 to 21 for individual taxa. Emergent biomass averaged 10{\%} (range = 2-35{\%}) of larval production; larval mortality within ponds accounted for the difference. Hydroperiod and intraguild predation limited larval production in some ponds, but emerging metamorphs exported an average of 70.0+/-33.9 g AFDM year(-1) (range = 21.0-135.2 g AFDM year(-1)) from ponds to surrounding forest. For the three ponds where larvae survived to metamorphosis, salamander assemblages provided an average net flux of 349.5+/-140.8 g AFDM year(-1) into pond habitats. Among all ponds, net flux into ponds was highest for the largest pond and decreased for smaller ponds with higher perimeter to surface area ratios (r2 = 0.94, P{\textless}0.05, n = 5). These results are important in understanding the multiple functional roles of salamanders and the impact of amphibian population declines on ecosystems.},

@article{Douma2019,
abstract = {Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {\textgreater}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

Recent research suggests that non-native Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) invasions may negatively affect the performance of larval American Toad tadpoles (Bufo americanus), and that compounds leached from L. salicaria leaves play a direct or indirect role in this effect.$\backslash$n* 2We raised individual B. americanus and Gray Treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles on high-quality diets in aqueous extracts of senescent leaves from L. salicaria, native Broad-Leaf Cattail (Typha latifolia), and control water to determine whether loosestrife extracts directly affect anuran tadpole performance.$\backslash$n* 3Even at high artificial food levels, B. americanus survival was significantly lower in L. salicaria extracts compared with T. latifolia extracts and a water control. Food level strongly affected B. americanus development, but tadpoles raised in L. salicaria extract were less developed compared with conspecifics raised in cattail extract or water. Unlike B. americanus, Hyla performance was not affected by exposure to any plant extract compared with the water control.$\backslash$n* 4Our study implicates secondary plant compounds as a mechanism underlying the impact of an invasive plant on some but not all native fauna. We hypothesize that high tannin concentrations of L. salicaria leaves have the potential to create environments that are directly toxic to B. americanus tadpoles. We hypothesize that obligate gill breathers such as B. americanus tadpoles are highly sensitive to gill damage caused by high concentrations of phenolics. Other anuran species such as H. versicolor that develop well-functioning lungs early may be less affected by high tannin concentrations.},

abstract = {Background: Variable importance measures for random forests have been receiving increased attention as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in bioinformatics and related scientific fields, for instance to select a subset of genetic markers relevant for the prediction of a certain disease. We show that random forest variable importance measures are a sensible means for variable selection in many applications, but are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. This is particularly important in genomics and computational biology, where predictors often include variables of different types, for example when predictors include both sequence data and continuous variables such as folding energy, or when amino acid sequence data show different numbers of categories. Results: Simulation studies are presented illustrating that, when random forest variable importance measures are used with data of varying types, the results are misleading because suboptimal predictor variables may be artificially preferred in variable selection. The two mechanisms underlying this deficiency are biased variable selection in the individual classification trees used to build the random forest on one hand, and effects induced by bootstrap sampling with replacement on the other hand. Conclusion: We propose to employ an alternative implementation of random forests, that provides unbiased variable selection in the individual classification trees. When this method is applied using subsampling without replacement, the resulting variable importance measures can be used reliably for variable selection even in situations where the potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories. The usage of both random forest algorithms and their variable importance measures in the R system for statistical computing is illustrated and documented thoroughly in an application re-analyzing data from a study on RNA editing. Therefore the suggested method can be applied straightforwardly by scientists in bioinformatics research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Strobl et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Soil nitrogen environments are highly heterogeneous, containing microsites that differ in relative and absolute ammonium and nitrate contents. We investigated whether black birch (Betula lenta L.) seedlings can maximize growth by foraging preferentially for a particular form of nitrogen, and whether supply rate of N and ammonium: nitrate in a patch affects preferences. Seedlings were transplanted into 5 1 split pots with roots partitioned evenly, and assigned to 1 of 4 nitrogen form treatments: nitrate (NO3−) both sides, ammonium (NH4+) both sides, NH4NO3, ‘homogeneous choice, and NO3−one side/NH4+on the other, ‘patchy choice, crossed with two rates of nitrogen supply. Use of15N–labelled nitrate revealed the proportion of seedling N from nitrate. Seedlings offered a patchy choice did not significantly out–perform seedlings in homogeneous ammonium and nitrate treatments, whereas seedlings offered a homogeneous choice did out–perform homogeneous nitrate and patchy choice treatment plants. In choice treatments, approx. 35 {\%} of seedling N came from a nitrate source. This selectivity was unaffected by rate of nitrogen application and ammonium: nitrate ratio. That patchy choice seedlings integrated patches to achieve this ammonium: nitrate uptake suggests that black birch has a preferred balance. The seedlings offered a homogeneous choice were significantly heavier than the seedlings offered a patchy choice, perhaps reflecting an additional cost of foraging for ammonium and nitrate separately.

abstract = {We examined historical patterns of land use of depression wetlands (Carolina bay and bay-like wetlands) to determine if a relationship between vegetative successional changes over a 41-year period and previous human disturbances (primarily agricultural) could be established. Land cover was interpreted from 1951 (black and white) and 1992 (false color infrared) aerial photography of the Savannah River Site (a 780 km(2) federal nuclear facility in which wetlands have been relatively undisturbed since 1951). Patterns of change from one land cover to another were detected by constructing a series of frequency tables. About one fourth of the 299 wetlands identified were either pasture or cultivated in 1951, and the majority had been ditched for drainage. Agriculturally disturbed wetlands primarily became mixed hardwood/pine or were converted to pine plantations by 1992 however no successional differences between wetlands that were cultivated versus pasture were detectable. The type of land use of many of the depression wetlands prior to 1951 probably was determined by physical characteristics of the wetlands (e.g., topographic position, size, and hydrologic features). Thus, in many cases, separation of recovery trajectories: from other successional pathways, initial hydrogeomorphic differences, and/or continued human influences is not possible in this study. However, from this change-detection study, we recognize that many of the currently protected depression wetlands at SRS were disturbed by agricultural practices or were impacted by hydrologic alterations prior to 1951, implying considerable resilience in the recovery toward a functioning wetland condition if hydrologic regimes are restored. A significant finding of this study is the relative stability of herb-dominated bays, which indicates that this vegetation type is not necessarily a successional continuum toward an eventual hardwood forest, at least in the temporal scale of the study. Thus, we suggest that management prescriptions for the restoration/conservation of herb-dominated wetlands should incorporate concepts of temporal stability within a framework of cyclical hydrologic and vegetation changes.},

abstract = {El Nĩo events, characterized by anomalous warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, have global climatic teleconnections and are the most dominant feature of cyclic climate variability on subdecadal timescales. Understanding changes in the frequency or characteristics of El Nĩo events in a changing climate is therefore of broad scientific and socioeconomic interest. Recent studies show that the canonical El Nĩo has become less frequent and that a different kind of El Nĩo has become more common during the late twentieth century, in which warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the central Pacific are flanked on the east and west by cooler SSTs. This type of El Nĩo, termed the central Pacific El Nĩo (CP-El Nĩo; also termed the dateline El Nĩo, El Nĩo Modoki or warm pool El Nĩo), differs from the canonical eastern Pacific El Nĩo (EP-El Nĩo) in both the location of maximum SST anomalies and tropical-midlatitude teleconnections. Here we show changes in the ratio of CP-El Nĩo to EP-El Nĩo under projected global warming scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model data set. Using calculations based on historical El Nĩo indices, we find that projections of anthropogenic climate change are associated with an increased frequency of the CP-El Nĩo compared to the EP-El Nĩo. When restricted to the six climate models with the best representation of the twentieth-century ratio of CP-El Nĩo to EP-El Nĩo, the occurrence ratio of CP-El Nĩo/EP-El Nĩo is projected to increase as much as five times under global warming. The change is related to a flattening of the thermocline in the equatorial Pacific. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

This study indicates that Gambusia can quickly and dramatically impact tadpole populations even at low predator densities and can forage effectively in vegetated areas that might normally serve as prey refugia from larger predatory fish (e.g., Lepomis spp.). Moreover, the influence of habitat complexity on predator-prey interactions may be species-specific. The number of H. squirella tadpoles consumed was not affected significantly by the degree of habitat complexity; however, consumption of G. carolinensis by Gambusia decreased with increasing habitat complexity.

abstract = {Synthesis of the literature suggests that physical, chemical, and biological elements of a watershed interact with long-term climate to influence fire regime, and that these factors, in concordance with the postfire vegetation mosaic, combine with local-scale weather to govern the trajectory and magnitude of change following a fire event. Perturbation associated with hydrological processes is probably the primary factor influencing postfire persistence of fishes, benthic macroinvertebrates, and diatoms in fluvial systems. It is apparent that salmonids have evolved strategies to survive perturbations occurring at the frequency of wildland fires (10°–10 2 years), but local populations of a species may be more ephemeral. Habitat alteration probably has the greatest impact on individual organisms and local populations that are the least mobile, and reinvasion will be most rapid by aquatic organisms with high mobility. It is becoming increasingly apparent that during the past century fire suppression has altered fire regimes in some vegetation types, and consequently, the probability of large stand-replacing fires has increased in those areas. Current evidence suggests, however, that even in the case of extensive high-severity fires, local extirpation of fishes is patchy, and recolonization is rapid. Lasting detrimental effects on fish populations have been limited to areas where native populations have declined and become increasingly isolated because of anthropogenic activities. A strategy of protecting robust aquatic communities and restoring aquatic habitat structure and life history complexity in degraded areas may be the most effective means for insuring the persistence of native biota where the probability of large-scale fires has increased. {\textcopyright} 1999 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Aim Habitat loss and degradation are the factors threatening the largest number of amphibian species. However, quantitative measures of habitat availability only exist for a small subset of them. We evaluated the relationships between habitat availability, extinction risk and drivers of threat for the world's amphibians. We developed deductive habitat suitability models to estimate the extent of suitable habitat and the proportion of suitable habitat (PSH) inside the geographic range of each species, covering species and areas for which little or no high-resolution distribution data are available. Location Global. Methods We used information on habitat preferences to develop habitat suitability models at 300-m resolution, by integrating range maps with land cover and elevation. Model performance was assessed by comparing model output with point localities where species were recorded. We then used habitat availability as a surrogate of area of occupancy. Using the IUCN criteria, we identified species having narrow area of occupancy, for which extinction risk is likely underestimated. Results We developed models for 5363 amphibians. Validation success of models was high (94{\%}), being better for forest specialists and generalists than for open habitat specialists. Generalists had proportionally more habitat than forest or open habitat specialists. The PSH was lower for species having small geographical ranges, currently listed as threatened, and for which habitat loss is recognized as a threat. Differences in habitat availability among biogeographical realms were strong. We identified 61 forest species for which the extinction risk may be higher that currently assessed in the Red List, due to limited extent of suitable habitat. Main conclusions Habitat models can accurately predict amphibian distribution at fine scale and allow describing biogeographical patterns of habitat availability. The strong relationship between amount of suitable habitat and extinction threat may help the conservation assessment in species for which limited information is currently available.},

abstract = {Desertification is often characterized by the replacement of mesophytic grasses with xerophytic shrubs. Livestock grazing is considered a key driver of shrub encroachment, although most evidence is anecdotal or confounded by other factors. Mapping of velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) shrubs in and out of exclosures in 1932, 1948, and 2006 in semiarid grasslands of southeastern Arizona, USA, afforded the opportunity to quantify livestock grazing effects on mesquite proliferation over 74 years in the absence of fire to test the widespread assumption that livestock grazing promotes shrub proliferation. In 1932, shrub cover, density, and aboveground biomass were compared on grazed (12{\%}, 173 plants/ha, 4182 kg/ha) and newly protected areas (8{\%}, 203 plants/ha, 3119 kg/ha). By 1948, cover on both areas increased to ∼18{\%}; yet, density on the protected area increased 300{\%} (to 620 plants/ha), nearly twice that of the grazed area (325 plants/ha). From 1932 to 1948, differences in recruitment of new plants and growth of existing plants were reflected in biomass, which was higher on the protected area (415 plants/ha, 8788 kg/ha) relative to the grazed area (155 plants/ha, 7085 kg/ha), although mortality was equally low (∼0.06{\%}). In 2006, 42 years after an herbicide application reset mesquite cover to ∼10{\%} on both areas, aboveground mesquite mass was comparable on both areas (∼4700 kg/ha), but cover and density on the protected area (22{\%}, 960 plants/ha) exceeded that on the grazed area (15{\%}, 433 plants/ha). Mesquite mass in 2006 was substantially below 1948 levels, so continued accrual is likely. That shrub recovery from herbicides on a biomass basis was much less than recovery on a cover basis suggests that remotely sensed biomass estimates should integrate land management history. Contrary to widely held assumptions, protection from livestock since 1932 not only failed to deter woody-plant proliferation, but actually promoted it relative to grazed areas. Results suggest (1) that thresholds for grassland resistance to shrub encroachment had been crossed by the 1930s, and (2) fire management rather than grazing management may be key to maintaining grassland physiognomy in this bioclimatic region. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Landscape structure is important for shaping the abundance and distribution of amphibians, but prior studies of landscape effects have been species or ecosystem-specific. Using a large-scale, citizen science-generated database, we examined the effects of habitat composition, road disturbance, and habitat split (i.e. the isolation of wetland from forest by intervening land use) on the distribution and richness of frogs and toads in the eastern and central United States. Undergraduates from nine biology and environmental science courses collated occupancy data and characterized landscape structure at 1617 sampling locations from the North American Amphibian Monitoring Program. Our analysis revealed that anuran species richness and individual species distributions were consistently constrained by both road density and traffic volume. In contrast, developed land around wetlands had small, or even positive effects on anuran species richness and distributions after controlling for road effects. Effects of upland habitat composition varied among species, and habitat split had only weak effects on species richness or individual species distributions. Mechanisms underlying road effects on amphibians involve direct mortality, behavioral barriers to movement, and reduction in the quality of roadside habitats. Our results suggest that the negative effects of roads on amphibians occur across broad geographic regions, affecting even common species, and they underscore the importance of developing effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of roads on amphibian populations.},

abstract = {Tropical rainfall patterns control the subsistence lifestyle of more than one billion people. Seasonal changes in these rainfall patterns are associated with changes in the position of the intertropical convergence zone, which is characterized by deep convection causing heavy rainfall near 10° N in boreal summer and 3° N in boreal winter. Dynamic controls on the position of the intertropical convergence zone are debated, but palaeoclimatic evidence from continental Asia, Africa and the Americas suggests that it has shifted substantially during the past millennium, reaching its southernmost position some time during the Little Ice Age (AD 1400-1850). However, without records from the meteorological core of the intertropical convergence zone in the Pacific Ocean, quantitative constraints on its position are lacking. Here we report microbiological, molecular and hydrogen isotopic evidence from lake sediments in the Northern Line Islands, Gal{\'{a}}pagos and Palau indicating that the Pacific intertropical convergence zone was south of its modern position for most of the past millennium, by as much as 500 km during the Little Ice Age. A colder Northern Hemisphere at that time, possibly resulting from lower solar irradiance, may have driven the intertropical convergence zone south. We conclude that small changes in Earths radiation budget may profoundly affect tropicalrainfall. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

These values are shaped by the aesthetic, cultural, and recreational benefits and services provided by those landscapes. However, across the globe, processes such as urbanization, agricultural intensification, and abandonment are threatening landscape integrity, altering the personally meaningful connections people have toward specific places. Existing methods used to study landscape values, such as social surveys, are poorly suited to capture dynamic landscape-scale processes across large geographic extents. Social media data, by comparison, can be used to indirectly measure and identify valuable features of landscapes at a regional, continental, and perhaps even worldwide scale. We evaluate the usefulness of different social media platforms - Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram - and quantify landscape values at a continental scale. We find Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram data can be used to quantify landscape values, with features of Instagram being especially suitable due to its relatively large population of users and its functional ability of allowing users to attach personally meaningful comments and hashtags to their uploaded images. Although Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram have different user profiles, our analysis revealed similar patterns of landscape values across Europe across the three platforms. We also found variables describing accessibility, population density, income, mountainous terrain, or proximity to water explained a significant portion of observed variation across data from the different platforms. Social media data can be used to extend our understanding of how and where individuals ascribe value to landscapes across diverse social, political, and ecological boundaries.},

abstract = {Understanding why some parks are used more regularly or intensely than others can inform ways in which urban parkland is developed and managed to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding urban population. Although geolocated social media (GSM) indicators have been used to examine park visitation rates, studies applying this approach are generally limited to flagship parks, national parks, or a small subset of urban parks. Here, we use geolocated Flickr and Twitter data to explore variation in use across New York City's 2143 diverse parks and model visitation based on spatially-explicit park characteristics and facilities, neighborhood-level accessibility features and neighborhood-level demographics. Findings indicate that social media activity in parks is positively correlated with proximity to public transportation and bike routes, as well as particular park characteristics such as water bodies, athletic facilities, and impervious surfaces, but negatively associated with green space and increased proportion of minority ethnicity and minority race in neighborhoods in which parks are located. Contrary to previous studies which describe park visitation as a form of nature-based recreation, our findings indicate that the kinds of green spaces present in many parks may not motivate visitation. From a social equity perspective, our findings may imply that parks in high-minority neighborhoods are not as accessible, do not accommodate as many visitors, and/or are of lower quality than those in low-minority neighborhoods. These implications are consistent with previous studies showing that minority populations disproportionately experience barriers to park access. In applying GSM data to questions of park access, we demonstrate a rapid, big data approach for providing information crucial for park management in a way that is less resource-intensive than field surveys.},

abstract = {Simultaneous environmental changes challenge biodiversity persistence and human wellbeing. The science and practice of restoration ecology, in collaboration with other disciplines, can contribute to overcoming these challenges. This endeavor requires a solid conceptual foundation based in empirical research which confronts, tests and influences theoretical developments. We review conceptual developments in restoration ecology over the last 30 years. We frame our review in the context of changing restoration goals which reflect increased societal awareness of the scale of environmental degradation and the recognition that inter-disciplinary approaches are needed to tackle environmental problems. Restoration ecology now encompasses facilitative interactions and network dynamics, trophic cascades, and above- and below ground linkages. It operates in a non-equilibrium, alternative states framework, at the landscape scale, and in response to changing environmental, economic and social conditions. Progress has been marked by conceptual advances in the fields of trait-environment relationships, community assembly, and understanding the links between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Conceptual and practical advances have been enhanced by applying evolving technologies, including treatments to increase seed germination and overcome recruitment bottlenecks, high throughput DNA sequencing to elucidate soil community structure and function, and advances in satellite technology and GPS tracking to monitor habitat use. The synthesis of these technologies with systematic reviews of context dependencies in restoration success, model based analyses and consideration of complex socio-ecological systems will allow generalizations to inform evidence based interventions. Ongoing challenges include setting realistic, socially acceptable goals for restoration under changing environmental conditions, and prioritizing actions in an increasingly space-competitive world. Ethical questions also surround the use of genetically modified material, translocations, taxon substitutions, and de-extinction, in restoration ecology. Addressing these issues, as the Ecological Society of America looks to its next century, will require current and future generations of researchers and practitioners, including economists, engineers, philosophers, landscape architects, social scientists and restoration ecologists, to work together with communities and governments to rise to the environmental challenges of the coming decades.},

abstract = {1. Food webs represent the paths of material and energy flow through organisms in an ecosystem. Anuran larvae are important components of pond food webs: they are abundant, consume large quantities of food and serve as prey for many organisms. However, there are very basic uncertainties about the feeding ecology of anuran larvae; for instance, as to which trophic level they belong and whether species differ in resource use. Because anuran larvae have been employed in model systems in experimental ecology for decades, these uncertainties could lead to misinterpretation of published experiments, or inadequate designs of experiments directed at general, conceptual issues in ecology. 2. Using 13C and 15N stable isotope and gut content analyses of free-ranging and enclosed tadpoles of four ranid species (Lithobates sylvaticus, L. pipiens, L. clamitans, L. catesbeianus) in the food webs of six wetlands, we tested the following null hypotheses: (i) that anuran larvae are strict primary consumers; (ii) that they are non-selective feeders and therefore exhibit little feeding niche differentiation; (iii) that they are opportunistic consumers and (iv) that their diet remains unchanged through ontogeny. 3. All four species consumed and assimilated substantial amounts of animal food; bullfrog larvae, in particular, appear to be predatory. Significant feeding niche differentiation among species occurred with respect to the sources of carbon, consumption of animal matter and nutritional quality of food ingested. We further documented opportunistic feeding habits and ontogenetic shifts in diet. 4. Collectively, these studies revealed complex trophic relationships that might require a reconsideration of the role of anuran larvae in pond food webs, as well as a reinterpretation of results of previous studies employing anuran larvae in model experimental systems.},

abstract = {Roads may be one of the most common disturbances in otherwise continuous forested habitat in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Despite their obvious presence on the landscape, there is limited data on the ecological effects along a road edge or the size of the "road-effect zone." We sampled salamanders at current and abandoned road sites within the Nantahala National Forest, North Carolina (U.S.A.) to determine the road-effect zone for an assemblage of woodland salamanders. Salamander abundance near the road was reduced significantly, and salamanders along the edges were predominantly large individuals. These results indicate that the road-effect zone for these salamanders extended 35 m on either side of the relatively narrow, low-use forest roads along which we sampled. Furthermore, salamander abundance was significantly lower on old, abandoned logging roads compared with the adjacent upslope sites. These results indicate that forest roads and abandoned logging roads have negative effects on forest-dependent species such as plethodontid salamanders. Our results may apply to other protected forests in the southern Appalachians and may exemplify a problem created by current and past land use activities in all forested regions, especially those related to road building for natural-resource extraction. Our results show that the effect of roads reached well beyond their boundary and that abandonment or the decommissioning of roads did not reverse detrimental ecological effects; rather, our results indicate that management decisions have significant repercussions for generations to come. Furthermore, the quantity of suitable forested habitat in the protected areas we studied was significantly reduced: between 28.6{\%} and 36.9{\%} of the area was affected by roads. Management and policy decisions must use current and historical data on land use to understand cumulative impacts on forest-dependent species and to fully protect biodiversity on national lands.},
annote = {Very simple study that assessed road and edge effects on terrestrial salamanders in Appalachian forests. Roads were found to have a significant effect on salamander abundances, with fewer salamanders being found in closer proximity to roads, regardless of material or width. One plausible mechanism for this relationship is the impact roads have on ground substrates. In this study, leaf litter and soil moisture were lower as distance to road decreased. This explanation is even stronger, as macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance data was not found to significant explain any of the variation in salamander abundances within the transects. Only one salamander species (Plethodon metcalfi) was used for statistical inference in this study, as all others were found in low abundances across sites, regardless of location along the transects. This study provided yet more evidence for road and edge effects on salamanders, specifically suggesting that a 35-m buffer distance is critical to reduce negative impacts. Another interesting finding in this study was reduced abundances in old timber-management sites and along abandoned logging roads. Though this study was not designed to examine legacy effects of land-use history on terrestrial salamanders, the researchers did find circumstantial evidence that intensive land use may leave a long-term (i.e., at least 80 years) footprint in forest ecosystems.},

These changes clearly affect forests, but they can also affect aquatic ecosystems based on differences in the input quality of leaf litter, such as plant secondary compounds. These compounds vary in type and concentration depending on species and can be toxic to aquatic organisms. To examine toxic effects on Pseudacris maculata and Pseudacris crucifer tadpoles, we conducted 60-d laboratory experiments to compare leaf litter leachate from a dominant canopy species (red oak) and nonnative species (white pine) with an aquatic grass (prairie cordgrass) and plain water control. An additional experiment examined the effects of white pine on Bufo americanus, Hyla versicolor, and tannin concentrations in natural ponds. Compared with the control and grass, tree leaf extracts resulted in reduced tadpole survival. Leached compounds from pine reduced tadpole survival to 3 d or less. Tadpoles were able to metamorphose in significant numbers only from the two controls. The lowered survival with the red oak treatment might have been caused by lowered dissolved oxygen or high tannin concentrations. However, pine is known to have high concentrations of toxic monoterpenes, which should be investigated further. We found that tannin concentrations in natural ponds were much lower than the test concentrations, indicating that these results may represent worst-case scenarios or unrealistic concentrations.},

abstract = {Recent literature postulates that Galapagos follows global warming, with an increase in sea surface temperature (SST) and frequency and amplitude of El Ni{\~{n}}o events. However, pronounced La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions over the last decade gave rise to the question of whether the "ocean thermostat model", according to which heating of the tropics may lead to an increase in the temperature gradient across the equatorial Pacific, enhancing upwelling and surface cooling, may better describe what has recently occurred in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). A 44-year time series of measurements of SST, air temperature and rainfall taken on the Galapagos island of Santa Cruz revealed that Galapagos monthly mean SSTs have shown no pronounced trend, while annual rainfall has increased. Mean warm and cool season temperatures have slightly increased and decreased respectively, thereby increasing seasonality. Galapagos SST data did not correlate linearly with annual rainfall, which suggests that the latter is not a reliable proxy for reconstructing past SST trajectories. When compared with those of several ETP sites, the Galapagos SST series best correlates with those of Puerto Chicama (coastal Peru, 8°S) and Cocos Island (5°N). The Puerto Chicama time series, the longest available (1925-2006), showed a negative SST trend. Annual deviations in Galapagos SST from the trend line lie between the Chicama and Cocos Island curves, and follow the El Ni{\~{n}}o signals of the Chicama series in 1983, 1987, 1992 and 1997 more closely than the Cocos series. The Humboldt Current system coupled with the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation may be the main driver of interannual and interdecadal changes in the Galapagos climate. Since upwelling within the Humboldt Current has increased during the last decade of extended La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions, it is no surprise that the Galapagos climate has shown the same signal.

abstract = {Introductions of non-native predators and competitors appear to contribute to worldwide amphibian declines; however, potential negative impacts of invasive plants on habitat quality and amphibian populations have not been examined. Loss of diversity and alterations in ecosystem function associated with plant invasions may disrupt food webs, potentially leading to further declines of already threatened amphibian populations. We used a combination of small bins, mesocosms, and field experiments to examine the impacts of Eurasian purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) replacing native cattails (Typha latifolia) in North American freshwater wetlands on survival, developmental rate, and diet (fresh- water algae) of American toad (Bufo americanus) tadpoles. Tadpoles developed slower in L. salicaria compared to tadpoles developing in T. latifolia. This effect was consistent across experimental venues, although mesocosms showed this effect only in the second year of our study. Survival and development rates were always more variable in purple loosestrife than in cattail. In bins, tadpoles showed signifi- cantly reduced survival when raised in purple loosestrife extract and addition of leaf litter exacerbated this negative effect. Tadpole survival rates in mesocosms and field cages were not significantly different between plant species, most likely an effect of high variability among replicates. We suspect a combina- tion of direct toxicity of high tannin concentrations in L. salicaria leaves and their indirect negative impacts on aquatic food webs are responsible for these results. Tadpole gut analyses revealed differences in algal communities among venues and between L. salicaria and T. latifolia suggesting that alterations in tadpole food quality and quantity contribute to the observed reduced tadpole performance. The replacement of native wetland plant species by L. salicaria does not represent a simple exchange of eco- logical equivalents and the function of invaded habitats for native species has clearly changed. While we were investigating only a single amphibian species, our results suggest that the impact of L. salicaria on ecosystem processes and aquatic food webs may be more general and likely to negatively affect other wetland species. The threats non-indigenous plants represent for amphibian populations and food webs may be underestimated, and warrant further investigation. Introduction},

abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the largest threats to amphibian populations. However, most studies have not provided clear insights into their population-level implications. There is a critical need to investigate the mechanisms that underlie patterns of distribution and abundance. In order to understand the population- and species-level implications of habitat loss and fragmentation, it is necessary to move from site-specific inferences to assessments of how the influences of multiple factors interact across extensive landscapes to influence population size and population connectivity. The goal of this paper is to summarize the state of knowledge, identify information gaps and suggest research approaches to provide reliable knowledge and effective conservation of amphibians in landscapes experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation. Reliable inferences require attention to species-specific ecological characteristics and their interactions with environmental conditions at a range of spatial scales. Habitat connectivity appears to play a key role in regional viability of amphibian populations. In amphibians, population connectivity is predominantly effected through juvenile dispersal. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the short-term impact of habitat loss and fragmentation increases with dispersal ability. However, species with limited dispersal abilities are likely to be equally imperiled by habitat loss and fragmentation over longer time periods. Rigorous understanding of the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on amphibians will require species-specific, multi-scale, mechanistic investigations, and will be benefit from integrating large empirical field studies with molecular genetics and simulation modeling. Molecular genetic methods are particularly suited to quantifying the influences of habitat structure across large spatial extents on gene flow and population connectivity. Conservation strategies would benefit by moving from generalizations to species and process specific recommendations and by moving from site-specific actions to implementing conservation plans at multiple scales across broad landscapes. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Aim: We use a retrospective approach to reconstruct the past distribution of fire in New England and to investigate the important drivers of this pattern across the period of European arrival to North America. Location: Our study sites are in New England, and range from pitch pine and oak forests of coastal Massachusetts, pine and hardwood forests of central Massachusetts, and northern hardwood and spruce fir forests of northern Massachusetts and Vermont. Methods: We collected sediment profiles from eighteen lakes across the study area to assess fossil charcoal and pollen abundance over the past 1000 years, including the time period of European arrival and settlement. Results: Based on presettlement pollen composition, our study sites are divided into three vegetation types: (1) pitch pine and oak, (2) oak, pine and hardwood and (3) northern hardwoods. The abundance of presettlement charcoal in these lakes is closely related to climate and the composition of surrounding vegetation. Charcoal is most abundant in pitch pine forests and least common in northern hardwood forests. Following the arrival of Europeans, charcoal abundance increased at most sites substantially, and vegetation composition changed in a direction of either greater dominance by pitch pine or white pine, depending on whether the forests were located in the southern or northern part of New England. Main conclusions: The major factor influencing the distribution of fire across New England is climate, which has a direct effect on the physical conditions conducive to fire ignition and spread and an indirect effect on fire through its control on the distribution of vegetation at this spatial scale. We find evidence that other factors exert some control over local fire regimes as well including landforms and their impact on vegetation composition, firebreaks and prevailing winds. Native Americans likely influenced the local occurrence of fire, but their impact on regional fire regimes in New England is not apparent from this or other studies. However, additional palaeoecological, archaeological and historical work needs to be carried out to better address this question. In contrast, Europeans had a dramatic effect on fire throughout the New England landscape, increasing its occurrence almost everywhere.},

abstract = {We sampled blood from free-living spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) to test whether differences in the concentrations of a stress hormone (corticosterone) were associated with different qualities of breeding and migration habitat. Spotted salamanders are forest specialists that migrate to vernal pools to breed, and upland habitat degradation may have sub-lethal effects on animals that lead to population declines. An individual's level of physiological stress may function as a biomonitor for sub-lethal effects, and thus as a biomonitor for ecosystem quality. We compared unstressed (baseline) and stress-induced corticosterone concentrations in spotted salamanders: (1) at sites that differed in amount of forest loss; (2) during breeding migration across forest habitat versus pavement; (3) in microhabitats that varied in soil drainage and canopy cover. Removal of large amounts of terrestrial habitat surrounding a breeding pond was correlated with lower baseline (in males) and stress-induced corticosterone concentrations, which may indicate healthy individuals with a reduced ability to respond to additional stress or individuals experiencing chronic stress. Male salamanders migrating across pavement had elevated baseline corticosterone concentrations compared to animals migrating through a forest, consistent with an acute stress response. However, concentrations of corticosterone did not differ between individuals in microhabitats with canopy cover and well-drained soil versus those in microhabitats with no canopy cover and/or swampy soil. This endocrinological technique may be one useful measure of a population's health, helping to identify populations where further ecological study is recommended to evaluate conservation concerns.},

@article{Efford2012,
abstract = {The probability that a site has at least one individual of a species (‘occupancy') has come to be widely used as a state variable for animal population monitoring. The available statistical theory for estimation when detection is imperfect applies particularly to habitat patches or islands, although it is also used for arbitrary plots in continuous habitat. The probability that such a plot is occupied depends on plot size and home-range characteristics (size, shape and dispersion) as well as population density. Plot size is critical to the definition of occupancy as a state variable, but clear advice on plot size is missing from the literature on the design of occupancy studies. We describe models for the effects of varying plot size and home-range size on expected occupancy. Temporal, spatial, and species variation in average home-range size is to be expected, but information on home ranges is difficult to retrieve from species presence/absence data collected in occupancy studies. The effect of variable home-range size is negligible when plots are very large (.1003area of home range), but large plots pose practical problems. At the other extreme, sampling of ‘point' plots with cameras or other passive detectors allows the true ‘proportion of area occupied' to be estimated. However, this measure equally reflects home-range size and density, and is of doubtful value for population monitoring or cross-species comparisons. Plot size is ill-defined and variable in occupancy studies that detect animals at unknown distances, the commonest example being unlimited-radius point counts of song birds. We also find that plot size is ill-defined in recent treatments of ‘‘multi-scale'' occupancy; the respective scales are better interpreted as temporal (instantaneous and asymptotic) rather than spatial. Occupancy is an inadequate metric for population monitoring when it is confounded with home-range size or detection distance.},

abstract = {Geophagy, the deliberate ingestion of soil, is a widespread practice among animals, including humans. Although some cases are well documented, motivations and consequences of this practice on the health status of the consumer remain unclear. In this paper, we focused our study on chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of the Kibale National Park, Uganda, after observing they sometimes ingest soil shortly before or after consuming some plant parts such as leaves of Trichilia rubescens, which have in vitro anti-malarial properties. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of soil eaten by chimpanzees and soil used by the local healer to treat diarrhoea revealed similar composition, the clay mineralogy being dominated by kaolinite. We modelled the interaction between samples of the two types of soil and the leaves of T. rubescens in gastric and intestinal compartments and assayed the anti-malarial properties of these solutions. Results obtained for both soil samples are similar and support the hypothesis that soil enhances the pharmacological properties of the bio-available gastric fraction. The adaptive function of geophagy is likely to be multi-factorial. Nevertheless, the medical literature and most of occidental people usually consider geophagy in humans as an aberrant behaviour, symptomatic of metabolic dysfunction. Our results provide a new evidence to view geophagy as a practice for maintaining health, explaining its persistence through evolution.},

Loss of small wetlands resulted in total wetland area declining by 19{\%} (from 2032 to 1655 ha), total wetland number declining by 62{\%} (from 354 to 136 wetlands), and average inter-wetland distance increasing by 67{\%} (from 0.6 to 1.0 kin). Also, average upland-wetland proximity decreased by 50{\%} (0.5 to 1.0 kin), such that just 54{\%} of the landscape was within the maximum migration distance (1000 m) of terrestrial-dwelling and aquatic-breeding amphib- ians after toss of small wetlands, versus 90{\%} before loss. A spatially-structured demographic model revealed that local populations of turtles, small birds, and small mammals, stable under conditions of no wetland loss, faced a significant risk of extinction (P {\textgreater} 5{\%}) after loss of small wetlands. No change in metapopulation extinction risk was evident for salamanders or frogs, largely because high rates of population increase buffered these laxa agains! local extinction.

abstract = {Abstract Global urban sprawl and the rising popularity of water‐sensitive urban design (WSUD) has led to a surge in the number of wetlands constructed to collect and treat stormwater run‐off in cities around the world. However, contaminants such as heavy metals and pesticides present in stormwater adversely affect the survival, growth and reproduction of animals inhabiting these wetlands. A key question is whether wildlife can identify and avoid highly‐polluted wetlands. We investigated this question using pond‐breeding frogs across 67 urban wetlands in Melbourne, Australia, to determine if frogs are attempting to breed in wetlands that affect the fitness of their offspring. We found little evidence for any important relationships between species richness and the concentration of any of the contaminants assessed, and frogs were present and calling at even the most polluted wetlands. The proportion of fringing vegetation at a wetland had the greatest positive influence on the number of frog species present and the probability of occurrence of individual species, indicating that frogs inhabit wetlands with abundant vegetation, regardless of their pollution status. These wetlands contained contaminant levels similar to urban wetlands around the world, and at levels which reduce larval amphibian survival. These results are, thus, likely generalizable to other areas, suggesting that urban managers could inadvertently be creating ecological traps in countless cities, with significant conservation implications. Wetlands are important tools for the management of urban stormwater run‐off, but we need to ensure their construction does not facilitate declines in wetland‐dependent urban wildlife.

abstract = {Reconstructions of past climate are important for providing a historical context for evaluating the nature of 20th century climate change. Here, a number of percentile-based palaeoclimate reconstructions were used to isolate signals of both phases of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A total of 92 (82) El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a) events were reconstructed since A.D. 1525. Significantly, we introduce the most comprehensive La Ni{\~{n}}a event record compiled to date. This annual record of ENSO events can now be used for independent verification of climate model simulations, reconstructions of ENSO indices and as a chronological control for archaeologists/social scientists interested in human responses to past climate events. Although extreme ENSO events are seen throughout the 478-year ENSO reconstruction, approximately 43{\%} of extreme and 28{\%} of all protracted ENSO events (i.e. both El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a phase) occur in the 20th century. The post-1940 period alone accounts for 30{\%} of extreme ENSO years observed since A.D. 1525. These results suggest that ENSO may operate differently under natural (pre-industrial) and anthropogenic background states. As evidence of stresses on water supply, agriculture and natural ecosystems caused by climate change strengthens, studies into how ENSO will operate under global warming should be a global research priority. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We tested hypothesized relationships using a structural equation modeling approach that accounted for common behavioral antecedents within a sample of 1,124 nature-based recreationists and property owners in rural counties of New York, USA. We found that place attachment played an important role in strengthening connections between nature-based recreation and PEB. Birdwatching and hunting participation contributed independently and significantly to PEB, both directly and indirectly through effects on place meanings and place attachment. While birdwatching appeared to influence place attachment by impacting environmental place meanings, hunting exerted similar effects by affecting sociocultural place meanings. Ultimately, our synthesis results in the articulation of a comprehensive conservation–recreation model that could help researchers and practitioners identify and explore novel pathways to PEB.},

abstract = {Our wood-lots, of course, have a history, and we may often recover it for a hundred years back, though we do not...Yet if we attended more to the history of our lots we should manage them more wisely. H.D. Thoreau. 16 October 1860. Henry Thoreau, the great New England writer, thinker and naturalist, devoted his 'career' to observing, describing and interpreting (in some 2 million words in more than three dozen journal volumes) the natural and cultural characteristics of his nineteenth century landscape. Through these writings we not only learn a great deal about our land and its ancestry but we receive an impassioned, although balanced reverence for both the wild and cultural sides of nature. Thoreau also presents a means of interpreting landscapes based on keen observation, a strong awareness of natural history, and a recognition that insights to modern nature often lie in its past [Foster, D.R. (1999) Thoreau's country. Journey through a transformed landscape. Harvard University Press, Cambridge]. This paper argues that we take Thoreau's words and approach to conservation to heart and admonishes that we appreciate the historical processes driving long-term ecological changes as we attempt to conserve and restore the vegetation, wildlife and landscape of regions including New England. Over the past four centuries much of the eastern USA has been transformed by human activity as the heavily forested area was settled, cut, cleared and farmed through the mid-nineteenth century and then largely abandoned in haphazard fashion from active use and allowed to reforest naturally [Cronon, W. (1983) Changes in the land Indians, colonists and the ecology of New England. Hill and Wang, New York; Whitney, G.G. (1994) From coastal wilderness to fruited plain. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Foster, D.R. {\&} O'Keefe, J.F. (2000) New England forests through time: insights from the Harvard forest dioramas. Harvard Forest and Harvard University Press, Petersham and Cambridge; Hall, B. et al. (2002) Journal of Biogeography, 29, 1319-1335]. Rather remarkably, the present landscape of New England supports many more natural attributes and processes than at any time since before the American Revolution. As a consequence of its history the region's considerable variation in vegetation, wildlife and appearance is largely explained by the history of human use [Bellemare, J. et al. (2002) Journal of Biogeography, 29, 1401-1420; Gerhardt, F. {\&} Foster, D.R. (2002) Journal of Biogeography, 29, 1421-1437; Hall, B. et al. (2002) Journal of Biogeography, 29, 1319-1335; Eberhardt, R. et al. (2003) Ecological Applications (in press)]. Thus, although the region supports a diverse range of species, plant and animal assemblages, and landscapes, successful conservation strategies need to be based on a broad-scale approach that appreciates regional variation in natural and cultural history as well as current conditions [Foster, D.R. {\&} Motzkin, G. (1998) Northeastern Naturalist, 5, 111; Motzkin, G. {\&} Foster, D.R. (2002) Journal of Biogeography, 29, 1569-1589]. This approach must also work effectively with the general lack of regional planning and regulation and the predominant role of private ownership and control in New England [Berlik, M.M. et al. (2002) Journal of Biogeography, 29, 1557-1568]. When a geographical-historical perspective is adopted for this region, three major, and in many ways quite dissimilar, directions for conservation emerge that are consistent with the region's history and environmental variation, are being actively pursued by conservation organizations and agencies, and might be effectively coordinated on a broad scale today. These directions, as articulated by diverse organizations include: (1) wilderness preservation and the restoration and the conservation of wide-ranging species and broadscale ecological processes; (2) maintenance of cultural, predominantly agriculturally derived, landscapes; and (3) increased, environmentally sound harvesting and utilization of local forest resources. Individually, when applied in appropriate landscape contexts, each of these approaches can exert positive benefits on biodiversity, environmental processes and quality of life. When applied collectively in a coordinated geographical fashion that acknowledges and accommodates regional variation resulting from physical, biological, cultural and historical factors, these three directions in land management may provide a broad template for proactive conservation that generates local to global benefits. This paper examines each of these three conservation directions in relation to the region's history and current ecological condition, attempts to articulate the environmental rationale that supports these activities, and then presents an initial approach at positioning each across this varied region.},

abstract = {* Human activities, invasive species and climate change have altered the composition of native forest plant communities in North America. These changes have, in turn, altered the composition of leaf litter in woodland ponds with consequences for the organisms they harbour, such as amphibian larvae. * We used mesocosms to assess how 10 species of allochthonous litter, which differ in their regional abundance and chemical composition, affect ephemeral ponds. We were particularly interested in effects on larval amphibian fitness, including metamorphic mass, larval period and survival. * Litter had strong effects on the fitness of larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), water chemistry, and phytoplankton and periphyton biomass in the mesocosms. Litter from green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), a tree species in decline, enabled frog larvae to grow larger, develop faster and survive better than larvae from other litter treatments. Interestingly, three invasive wetland plant species produced heavy metamorphs, with shorter larval periods and higher survival relative to native wetland plants. Litter from red maple (Acer rubrum, now among the most abundant native trees in the eastern United States), cattail (Typha latifolia) and sedge (Carex stricta) produced metamorphs that were small and survived poorly. * Mass at metamorphosis was best explained by litter quality (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content) and primary producer biomass, while survival and larval period were best explained by a combination of litter quality, primary producer biomass and water chemistry (polyphenolics and pH). Additionally, litter quality and primary producer biomass explained differences in the elemental composition of metamorphs. Lastly, our data suggest that litter nitrogen may be a limiting resource that affects the export of metamorphic frog biomass from ephemeral ponds. * Overall, our results indicate that anthropogenic changes in plant communities lead to changes in the quality of allochthonous litter input and strongly affect amphibian fitness.},

abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of terrestrial ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools reflect internal processes and input-output balances. Disturbance generally in creases N cycling and loss, yet few studies have examined ecosystem S15N over a disturbance recovery sequence. We used a chronosequence approach to examine N distribution and 815N during forest regrowth after agricultural aban donment. Site ages ranged from 10 to 115 years, with similar soils, climate, land-use history, and overstory vegetation (white pine Pinus strobus). Foliar N and 515N decreased as stands aged, con sistent with a progressive tightening of the N cycle during forest regrowth on agricultural lands. Over time, foliar 515N became more negative, indicating increased fractionation along the min eralization-mycorrhizal-plant uptake pathway. Total ecosystem N was constant across the chro nosequence, but substantial internal N redistribu tion occurred from the mineral soil to plants and litter over 115 years ({\textgreater}25{\%} of ecosystem N or 1,610kg ha-1). Temporal trends in soil 515N generally reflected a redistribution of depleted N from the mineral soil to the developing O horizon. Although plants and soil 515N are coupled over millennial time scales of ecosystem development, our observed divergence between plants and soil suggests that they can be uncoupled during the disturbance-regrowth sequence. The approximate 2{\%}0 decrease in ecosystem 815N over the century scale suggests significant incorporation of atmo spheric N, which was not detected by traditional ecosystem N accounting. Consideration of tempo ral trends and disturbance legacies can improve our understanding of the influence of broader factors such as climate or N deposition on eco system},

abstract = {The retention of mature forest habitat elements (e.g., snags, downed wood, green trees) in clearcut forest stands is used to mitigate the negative impacts of timber harvesting on wildlife. We measured retained habitat elements and surveyed forest birds in recently ({\textless}15years old) clearcut forest stands within 4 locations across the Pacific Northwest of the United States, ranging from central Washington to northern California. Our objectives were to quantify the structural characteristics of retained habitat elements and identify how retention practices have shaped local breeding bird communities. We sampled 20-22 harvest units in each location. We used a multi-species, multi-scale occupancy model to estimate probabilities of occurrence at large (stand level) and small (within stand) scales for all observed bird species, including those that were rarely detected, in addition to generating estimates of species richness at the stand level. We compared local occupancy with an index of regional occupancy to identify species that were selecting or avoiding clearcuts with retention. Average green-tree diameters ranged from 33 to 42cm while snag diameters ranged from 34 to 74cm; single trees were often larger on average than trees retained in patches, depending on the region. Downed wood volumes ranged from 129 to 650m3ha-1, with the majority of volume ({\~{}}60-76{\%}) contributed by larger logs ({\textgreater}50cm in diameter). We observed 71 songbird and woodpecker species using clearcuts during 2008-2009. Stand-level richness varied within and across study regions (mean range: 30-38 species). We found species with considerably higher and lower probabilities of occurrence than predicted by regional occurrence, suggesting that clearcuts with retention were valued differently by members of the forest bird community in each region. Upper canopy/bark foraging species generally occurred within clearcuts less often than expected, while cavity-nesting species exhibited a range of positive and negative relationships that sometimes differed by region. Our results provide context for understanding the contribution of retained habitat elements to forest birds and can potentially guide future monitoring activities pertaining to conservation of forest species in managed landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd Population genetic theory related to the consequences of rapid population decline is well-developed, but there are very few empirical studies where sampling was conducted before and after a known bottleneck event. Such knowledge is of particular importance for species restoration, given links between genetic diversity and the probability of long-term persistence. To directly evaluate the relationship between current genetic diversity and past demographic events, we collected genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data from prebottleneck historical (c.1906) and postbottleneck contemporary (c.2014) samples of Pinz{\'{o}}n giant tortoises (Chelonoidis duncanensis; n = 25 and 149 individuals, respectively) endemic to a single island in the Galapagos. Pinz{\'{o}}n giant tortoises had a historically large population size that was reduced to just 150–200 individuals in the mid 20th century. Since then, Pinz{\'{o}}n's tortoise population has recovered through an ex situ head-start programme in which eggs or pre-emergent individuals were collected from natural nests on the island, reared ex situ in captivity until they were 4–5 years old and subsequently repatriated. We found that the extent and distribution of genetic variation in the historical and contemporary samples were very similar, with the latter group not exhibiting the characteristic genetic patterns of recent population decline. No population structure was detected either spatially or temporally. We estimated an effective population size (Ne) of 58 (95{\%} CI = 50–69) for the postbottleneck population; no prebottleneck Nepoint estimate was attainable (95{\%} CI = 39–infinity) likely due to the sample size being lower than the true Ne. Overall, the historical sample provided a valuable benchmark for evaluating the head-start captive breeding programme, revealing high retention of genetic variation and no skew in representation despite the documented bottleneck event. Moreover, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of head-starting in rescuing the Pinz{\'{o}}n giant tortoise from almost certain extinction.},

abstract = {Loss of key plant-animal interactions (e.g., disturbance, seed dispersal, and herbivory) due to extinctions of large herbivores has diminished ecosystem functioning nearly worldwide. Mitigating for the ecological consequences of large herbivore losses through the use of ecological replacements to fill extinct species' niches and thereby replicate missing ecological functions has been proposed. It is unknown how different morphologically and ecologically a replacement can be from the extinct species and still provide similar functions. We studied niche equivalency between 2 phenotypes of Gal{\'{a}}pagos giant tortoises (domed and saddlebacked) that were translocated to Pinta Island in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Archipelago as ecological replacements for the extinct saddlebacked giant tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdonii). Thirty-nine adult, nonreproductive tortoises were introduced to Pinta Island in May 2010, and we observed tortoise resource use in relation to phenotype during the first year following release. Domed tortoises settled in higher, moister elevations than saddlebacked tortoises, which favored lower elevation arid zones. The areas where the tortoises settled are consistent with the ecological conditions each phenotype occupies in its native range. Saddlebacked tortoises selected areas with high densities of the arboreal prickly pear cactus (Opuntia galapageia) and mostly foraged on the cactus, which likely relied on the extinct saddlebacked Pinta tortoise for seed dispersal. In contrast, domed tortoises did not select areas with cactus and therefore would not provide the same seed-dispersal functions for the cactus as the introduced or the original, now extinct, saddlebacked tortoises. Interchangeability of extant megaherbivores as replacements for extinct forms therefore should be scrutinized given the lack of equivalency we observed in closely related forms of giant tortoises. Our results also demonstrate the value of trial introductions of sterilized individuals to test niche equivalency among candidate analog species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.},

The goal of a drought index is to provide a simple, quantitative assessment of three drought characteristics: intensity, duration, and spatial extent. A drought index should also provide a historical reference that can be used to compare current conditions with past conditions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTThe cost and time of pharmaceutical drug development continue to grow at rates that many say are unsustainable. These trends have enormous impact on what treatments get to patients, when they get them and how they are used. The statistical framework for supporting decisions in regulated clinical development of new medicines has followed a traditional path of frequentist methodology. Trials using hypothesis tests of “no treatment effect” are done routinely, and the p-value {\textless} 0.05 is often the determinant of what constitutes a “successful” trial. Many drugs fail in clinical development, adding to the cost of new medicines, and some evidence points blame at the deficiencies of the frequentist paradigm. An unknown number effective medicines may have been abandoned because trials were declared “unsuccessful” due to a p-value exceeding 0.05. Recently, the Bayesian paradigm has shown utility in the clinical drug development process for its probability-based inference. We argue for a Bayesian approach tha...},

Species that are Red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declined an average of 11.6{\%} annually.

abstract = {The Far North of Ontario encompasses 45.2 million hectares of land, with peatlands—defined here as non-forested bogs and fens—as the dominant land class, accounting for nearly 50{\%} of the landscape and storing approximately 36 Gt (1 Gt = 1015 g) of carbon. The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) account for nearly 50{\%} of the land area and stores about 75{\%} of the peatland carbon in the Far North. The HBL is the largest peatland complex with the southernmost distribution of non-alpine permafrost in North America. More than 75{\%} of the HBL occurs in Ontario, where the provincial Far North Act mandates that the vulnerability of ecosystems to climate change, and their carbon storage and sequestration potential, be considered in land use planning. Because peatlands account for nearly 75{\%} of the HBL landscape, we reviewed the peatland literature and identified peatland succession, permafrost thaw, hydrology, and fire as potential climate change indicators that drive peatland carbon budgets. As well, remote sensing can be used to scale these indicators to estimate current and project future states of the HBL landscape and the strength of its carbon sink. We propose two hypotheses of potential climate change effects on peatland carbon in the HBL: (1) in northern ecoregions accelerated permafrost thawing and wetter peat enhances methane emissions and (2) in southern ecoregions increased evapotranspiration and drier peat accelerates carbon dioxide losses through peat decomposition (and possible fire). We also propose a climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessment framework for HBL peatlands and discuss challenges to its development and application in land use planning.},

We use the locations of photographs in flickr to estimate visitation rates at 836 recreational sites around the world, and use information from the profiles of the photographers to derive travelers' origins. We compare these estimates to empirical data at each site and conclude that the crowd-sourced information can indeed serve as a reliable proxy for empirical visitation rates.

abstract = {Riparian zones are the interface between aquatic and terrestrial systems along inland watercourses. They have a disproportionate ecological role in the landscape considering their narrow extent, which makes them a good example of small natural features (sensu Hunter, 2017-inthisissue). Characteristically, riparian zones increase species richness in the landscape and provide key services to society, such as soil fertility, water purification, and recreation. Despite the recognized importance of riparian zones for ecological, economic and social reasons, and the vast amount of scientific literature exploring measures for their conservation, current management is still failing at enabling a proper ecological functioning of these areas. The best practices for conservation of riparian zones have mostly focused on manipulating biotic and physical components (e.g. renaturalizing flow regimes, improving channel mobility, and controlling invasions of exotic ecosystem engineer species). However, these strategies face important technical, socio-economic, and legal constraints that require a more integrative approach for effective conservation. In this paper we summarize the main problems affecting riparian zones and their current management challenges. Following Hunter et al. (2017-inthisissue), we review novel approaches to conservation of riparian zones, complementary to manipulating processes that reflect contemporary management and policy. These include (1) investing in environmental education for both local people and technical staff, (2) guaranteeing qualitative and long term inventories and monitoring, (3) establishing legislation and solutions to protect riparian zones, (4) framing economic activities in riparian zones under sustainable management, and (5) planning restoration of riparian zones at multiple and hierarchical spatio-temporal scales.},

A new type of model averaging estimator based on model selection with Akaike's AIC is used with linear regression to investigate the problems of likely inclusion of spurious effects and model selection bias, the bias introduced while using the data to select a single seemingly “best” model from a (often large) set of models employing many predictor variables. The new model averaging estimator helps reduce these problems and provides confidence interval coverage at the nominal level while traditional stepwise selection has poor inferential properties.},

abstract = {Summary: Restored and constructed habitats can play important conservation roles. Predators help shape communities in these habitats through complex interactions with prey, other predators and biotic and abiotic characteristics of the environment. However, introduced predators can have dramatic effects that may be difficult to predict. Using regression models, we compared influences of introduced invasive western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis to those of two naturally colonizing predators (crayfish and dragonflies), and vegetation, on three anuran species in experimentally constructed wetlands. Using analyses of covariance, we also examined influences of mosquitofish and vegetation on aquatic invertebrate communities. We found that mosquitofish reduced abundances of grey treefrogs Hyla versicolor and H. chrysoscelis and boreal chorus frog Pseudacris maculata, but had no significant influence on green frog Lithobates clamitans. Mosquitofish also reduced invertebrate abundance, but their effect on richness was less clear. Vegetation cover did not significantly increase most anuran or invertebrate abundances. However, vegetation increased invertebrate richness. After fish removal, invertebrate abundance increased. Fish removal may have facilitated chorus frog re-colonization into wetlands with low abundance of invertebrate predators. Our results indicate that mosquitofish are detrimental to wetland communities, and we recommend that managers avoid stocking mosquitofish. We also encourage temporary or drainable wetlands to prevent mosquitofish persistence if colonization occurs. Implementing these recommendations will improve the conservation potential of restored wetlands. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Funding for basic conservation research is chronically lacking. The potential for ecotourism to fund conservation research exists, but has been little explored. One branch of ecotourism with funding potential is volunteer tourism, where conservation scientists and recruiting agencies develop research projects and volunteers provide funding and labor. We examine the costs and benefits of a three-way partnership among a conservation research project (The Tambopata Macaw Project), an ecotourism operator (Rainforest Expeditions), and a volunteer-recruiting NGO (the Earthwatch Institute). From November 1999 to December 2006, Macaw Project researchers invested about 1700 h in giving research presentations and interacting with ecotourists and received from Rainforest Expeditions ∼{\$}278,000 worth of salaries, transportation, food, and lodging (total cost to Rainforest Expeditions ∼{\$}98,000). Since 2001, researchers invested 2300 h in training and supervising volunteers and related activities and received from Earthwatch 328 volunteers, ∼13 000 h of volunteer labor and {\$}115,000 in research funding. Rainforest Expeditions received {\$}175,000 in fees from Earthwatch for food and lodging for volunteers. In this association, all parties benefited financially: the research received {\textgreater}{\$}400,000 in cash, goods and services, Earthwatch retained {\$}387,000 in volunteer fees, and Rainforest Expeditions received nearly {\$}300,000 in gross income. Additional benefits to Rainforest Expeditions included services for their guests and free marketing through research related publications and word of mouth. We discuss ways to structure projects to maximize the benefits and the potential of this model for funding other long-term conservation research projects. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Willson2013,
abstract = {Although interwetland dispersal is thought to play an important role in regional persistence of pond-breeding amphibians, few researchers have modeled amphibian metapopulation or source-sink dynamics. Results of recent modeling studies suggest anthropogenic stressors, such as pollution, can negatively affect density and population viability of amphibians breeding in isolated wetlands. Presumably population declines also result in reduced dispersal to surrounding (often uncontaminated) habitats, potentially affecting dynamics of nearby populations. We used our data on the effects of mercury (Hg) on the American toad ( Bufo americanus) as a case study in modeling the effects of anthropogenic stressors on landscape-scale amphibian dynamics. We created a structured metapopulation model to investigate regional dynamics of American toads and to evaluate the degree to which detrimental effects of Hg contamination on individual populations can disrupt interpopulation dynamics. Dispersal from typical American toad populations supported nearby populations that would otherwise have been extirpated over long time scales. Through support of such sink populations, dispersal between wetland-associated subpopulations substantially increased overall productivity of wetland networks, but this effect declined with increasing interwetland distance and decreasing wetland size. Contamination with Hg substantially reduced productivity of wetland-associated subpopulations and impaired the ability of populations to support nearby sinks within relevant spatial scales. Our results add to the understanding of regional dynamics of pond-breeding amphibians, the wide-reaching negative effects of environmental contaminants, and the potential for restoration or remediation of degraded habitats.},

abstract = {This article has two objectives. The first and narrower is to formalize the p-value function, which records all possible p-values, each corresponding to a value for whatever the scalar parameter of interest is for the problem at hand, and to show how this p-value function directly provides full inference information for any corresponding user or scientist. The p-value function provides familiar inference objects: significance levels, confidence intervals, critical values for fixed-level tests, and the power function at all values of the parameter of interest. It thus gives an immediate accurate and visual summary of inference information for the parameter of interest. We show that the p-value function of the key scalar interest parameter records the statistical position of the observed data relative to that parameter, and we then describe an accurate approximation to that p-value function which is readily constructed.

abstract = {Climate change has been studied for many decades. Growing scientific, political, and public attention has focused on climate change and its effect on ecosystems, including lake ecosystems. In this study, we conducted comparative quantitative and qualitative analyses that focused on research development, current hotspots, and potential future directions of climate change research associated with lakes using a bibliometric analysis based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) database. A total of 10,296 papers associated with climate change-lake research were published in 1266 journals. Rapid development occurred over the past 25 years and the number of published papers considerably increased since the 2000s. A keyword analysis showed that among the top 50 most frequently used keywords, paleoecology, palynology, paleolimnology, climate change, and pollen analysis exhibited decreasing trends. Recently, eutrophication exhibited one of the highest co-occurrence frequencies with climate change. Keywords such as algae and cyanobacteria also showed increasing trends with climate change, implied that more attention was paid to the harmful cyanobacterial blooms. Another significant increasing trend was observed between climate change and remote sensing, which is a modern technology that is now widely used in limnology. Our results also indicate that a distinct turning point associated with climate change-lake research occurred between 1991 and 2015. Before the 2000s, most studies focused on paleolimnology. Specifically, researchers were searching for the evidence of climate change in lake sediments by using traditional technologies, such as reflecting ancient climate using the information recorded by diatom or pollen in the sediments. Recently, more studies have focused on modern limnology, e.g., the effects of climate change on lake ecosystems. In addition, future research may focus on the following topics: i) the interactive effects of climate change and eutrophication, or other environmental variables, on lake ecosystems; ii) solutions for mitigating the negative effects of climate change; and iii) the potential effects of eutrophication on climate change.},

@article{Wood2011,
abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton-Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

abstract = {The hydrological fate of shallow tundra lakes and ponds under conditions of continued warming remains uncertain, but has important implications for wildlife habitat and biogeochemical cycling. Observations of unprecedented pond desiccation, in particular, signify catastrophic loss of aquatic habitat in some Arctic locations. Shallow tundra ponds are a ubiquitous feature in the western Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), a region that has undergone intense warming over the past {\&}{\#}8764;50 years. But it remains unknown how hydrological processes in these ponds have responded. Here, we use cellulose-inferred pond water oxygen isotope records from sediment cores, informed by monitoring of modern pond water isotope compositions during the 2009 and 2010 ice-free seasons, to reconstruct hydrological conditions of four shallow tundra ponds in the western HBL over the past three centuries. Following an interval of relative hydrological stability during the early part of the records, results reveal widely differing hydrological responses to 20th century climate change among the study sites, which is largely dependent on hydrological connectivity of the basins within their respective surrounding peatlands. These findings suggest the 20th century has been characterized by an increasingly dynamic landscape that has variably influenced surface water balance {\&}{\#}8211; a factor that is likely to play a key role in determining the future water balance of ponds in this region.},

abstract = {1. Reliable assessment of animal populations is a long-standing challenge in wildlife ecology. Technological advances have led to widespread adoption of camera traps (CTs) to survey wildlife distribution, abundance and behaviour. As for any wildlife survey method, camera trapping must contend with sources of sampling error such as imperfect detection. Early applications focused on density estimation of naturally marked species, but there is growing interest in broad-scale CT surveys of unmarked populations and communities. Nevertheless, inferences based on detection indices are controversial, and the suitability of alternatives such as occupancy estimation is debatable. 2. We reviewed 266 CT studies published between 2008 and 2013. We recorded study objec- tives and methodologies, evaluating the consistency of CT protocols and sampling designs, the extent to which CT surveys considered sampling error, and the linkages between analyti- cal assumptions and species ecology. 3. Nearly two-thirds of studies surveyed more than one species, and a majority used response variables that ignored imperfect detection (e.g. presence–absence, relative abundance). Many studies used opportunistic sampling and did not explicitly report details of sampling design and camera deployment that could affect conclusions. 4. Most studies estimating density used capture–recapture methods on marked species, with spatially explicit methods becoming more prominent. Few studies estimated density for unmarked species, focusing instead on occupancy modelling or measures of relative abun- dance. While occupancy studies estimated detectability, most did not explicitly define key components of the modelling framework (e.g. a site) or discuss potential violations of model assumptions (e.g. site closure). Studies using relative abundance relied on assumptions of equal detectability, and most did not explicitly define expected relationships between mea- sured responses and underlying ecological processes (e.g. animal abundance and movement). 5. Synthesis and applications. The rapid adoption of camera traps represents an exciting tran- sition in wildlife survey methodology. We remain optimistic about the technology's promise, but call for more explicit consideration of underlying processes of animal abundance, move- ment and detection by cameras, including more thorough reporting of methodological details and assumptions. Such transparency will facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve the reliabil- ity of camera trap surveys, ultimately leading to stronger inferences and helping to meet mod- ern needs for effective ecological inquiry and biodiversity monitoring.},

abstract = {Waste rice seed is an important food for wintering waterfowl and current estimates of its availability are needed to determine the carrying capacity of rice fields and guide habitat conservation. We used a line-intercept method to estimate mass-density of rice seed remaining after harvest during 2010 in the Sacramento Valley (SACV) of California and compared results with estimates from previous studies in the SACV and Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV). Posterior mean (95{\%} credible interval) estimates of total waste rice seed mass-density for the SACV in 2010 were 388 (336-449) kg/ha in conventionally harvested fields and 245 (198-307) kg/ha in stripper-head harvested fields; the 2010 massdensity is nearly identical to the mid-1980s estimate for conventionally harvested fields but 36{\%} lower than the mid-1990s estimate for stripped fields. About 18{\%} of SACV fields were stripper-head harvested in 2010 vs. 9-15{\%} in the mid-1990s and 0{\%} in the mid-1980s; but due to a 50{\%} increase in planted rice area, total mass of waste rice seed in SACV remaining after harvest in 2010 was 43{\%} greater than in the mid-1980s. However, total mass of seed-eating waterfowl also increased 82{\%}, and the ratio of waste rice seed to seed-eating waterfowl mass was 21{\%} smaller in 2010 than in the mid-1980s. Mass-densities of waste rice remaining after harvest in SACV fields are within the range reported for MAV fields. However, because there is a lag between harvest and waterfowl use in the MAV but not in the SACV, seed loss is greater in the MAV and estimated waste seed mass-density available to wintering waterfowl in SACV fields is about 5-30 times recent MAV estimates. Waste rice seed remains an abundant food source for waterfowl wintering in the SACV, but increased use of stripper-head harvesters would reduce this food. To provide accurate data on carrying capacities of rice fields necessary for conservation planning, trends in planted rice area, harvest method, and postharvest field treatment should be tracked and impacts of postharvest field treatment and other farming practices on waste rice seed availability should be investigated.},

abstract = {Science denialism retards evidenced-based policy and practice and should be challenged. It has been a particular concern for mitigating global environmental issues, like anthropogenic climate change. But allegations of science denialism must also be well founded and evidential or they risk eroding public-trust in science and scientists. Recently, 67 scholars, scientists and science writers were accused of „invasive species denialism‟ (ISD) – the rejection of well-supported facts about invasive species, particularly the global scientific consensus about their negative impacts. We re-evaluated the ISD literature but could find no examples where scientific facts were refuted and just five articles with text perhaps consistent with one of the five characteristics of science denialism. We found, therefore, that allegations of ISD were misplaced. To understand why these accusations of science denialism have occurred we make two observations. First, invasion biology defines its subjects – invasive species – using multiple subjective and normative judgements. Thus, more than other applied sciences its consensus is one of shared values as much as agreed knowledge. Second, criticisms of invasion biology have largely targeted those subjective and normative judgments and their global imposition, not the discipline‟s knowledge. Regrettably, a few invasion biologists have misinterpreted the critique of their values-based consensus as a denial of their science when it is not. We provide some recommendations for making invasion biology a more robust and widely accepted, conservation science. A key recommendation is that invasion biology could avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and conflicts by being more accepting of perspectives originating from other disciplines, and more open to values-based critique from other scholars and scientists. This recommendation applies to all conservation sciences, especially those addressing global challenges, because they must serve and be relevant to communities with an extraordinary diversity of cultures and values.},

Our analysis of complementary datasets on tortoise demography and movement, tortoiseplant interactions and Espa{\~{n}}ola Island's vegetation history indicated that the repatriated tortoise population is secure from a strictly demographic perspective: about half of tortoises released on the island since 1975 were still alive in 2007, in situ reproduction is now significant, and future extinction risk is low with or without continued repatriation. Declining survival rates, somatic growth rates, and body condition of repatriates suggests, however, that resources for continued population growth are increasingly limited. Soil stable carbon isotope analyses indicated a pronounced shift toward woody plants in the recent history of the island's plant community, likely a legacy of changes in competitive relations between woody and herbaceous plants induced by now-eradicated feral goats and prolonged absence of tortoises. Woody plants are of concern because they block tortoise movement and hinder recruitment of cactus-a critical resource for tortoises. Tortoises restrict themselves to remnant cactus patches and areas of low woody plant density in the center of the island despite an apparent capacity to colonize a far greater range, likely because of a lack of cactus elsewhere on the island. We conclude that ecosystem-level criteria for success of species reintroduction efforts take much longer to achieve than population-level criteria; moreover, reinstatement of endangered species as fully functioning ecosystem engineers may often require largescale habitat restoration efforts in concert with population restoration.

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

The need for a refined analysis arises because the earlier work assumed that there is only a primary health outcome of interest, without secondary outcomes. An important aspect of choice between surveillance and aggressive treatment is that the latter may have side effects.

These data suggest that the P. cinereus population does not move underground The above-ground density of Plethodon cinereus did not vary over 22 sampling (where food is scarce) during short dry periods but instead that it maximizes the amount of time spent on the surface of the ground (where prey are abundant)},
annote = {Jaeger studied red-backed salamander populations in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia during the spring and summer of 1974 to understand how microhabitat preferences might be dependent on weather conditions. Salamander use of microhabitats was significantly related to precipitation - salamanders prefer logs and rocks when it is relatively dry and litter when it is relatively wet. This study provides some support for a horizontal movement concept of red-backed salamanders (rather than a vertical theory). Detection of individuals is both affected by the weather and the types of microhabitats inspected. Sites were only visited once in this study, which leaves many questions as to how accurate these conclusions are - though this was conducted in one part of one forest so we can assume habitat conditions are relatively homogenous across quadrats. 

Red-backed movement is primarily horizontal (even throughout weather changes) - maximizing where prey is abundanct

Habitat preference can be affected by the weather/moisture conditions
- More active in litter during and shortly after a precipitation event
- More likely to be in underground refuges and under moist logs during dry patches

Jaeger (1972) - hypothesized a horizontal movement pattern (litter to cover objects) over a variety of moisture conditions

Fraser (1976) - hypothesized a vertical movement pattern (litter to underground retreats) between wet/dry periods - foraging success is dependent upon salamander mobility.

Salamander densities not significantly associated with soil depth, litter depth, rainfall, or temperature. BUT, salamander densities in litter were significantly positively related with rainfall and densities under rocks/logs were significantly negatiely related with rainfall.},

Such courses can speed up the process of gaining statistical wisdom by giving students insight into the human propensity to make statistical errors, the meaning of a single test within a research project, ways in which p-values work and don't work as expected, the role of statistics in the lifecycle of science, and best practices for statistical communication. The course we have developed follows the story of how we use data to understand the world, leveraging simulation-based approaches to perform customized analyses and evaluate the behavior of statistical procedures. We provide ideas for expanding beyond the traditional classroom, two example activities, and a course syllabus as well as the set of statistical best practices for creating and consuming scientific information that we develop during the course.},

Using the state of Victoria, Australia as a case study, secondary crowdsourced VGI data, primary crowdsourced (PPGIS data) and visitor statistics were examined for their correspondence and differences, and to identify spatial patterns in park popularity. Data completeness—the percent of protected areas with data—varied between sources, being highest for OSM (90{\%}), followed by Flickr (41{\%}), PPGIS (24{\%}), visitation counts (5{\%}), and Wikipedia articles (4{\%}). Statistically significant correlations were found between all five measures of popularity for protected areas. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, the explained variability in visitor numbers was greater than 70{\%}, with PPGIS, Flickr and OSM having the largest standardized coefficients. The social importance of protected areas varied as a function of accessibility and the types of values (direct or indirect use) expressed for the areas. Crowdsourced data may provide an alternative to visitor counts for assessing protected area social importance and spatial variability of visitation.

abstract = {Environmental gradients are instrumental in shaping the distribution and local abundance of species because at the most fundamental level, an organism's performance is constrained by the environment it inhabits. In topographically complex landscapes, slope, aspect, and vegetative cover interact to affect solar exposure, creating temperature-moisture gradients and unique microclimates. The significance of the interaction of abiotic gradients and biotic factors such as competition, movement, or physiology has long been recognized, but the scale at which these factors vary on the landscape has generally precluded their inclusion in spatial abundance models. We used fine-scale spatial data relating to surface-soil moisture, temperature, and canopy cover to describe the spatial distribution of abundance of a terrestrial salamander, Plethodon albagula, across the landscape. Abundance was greatest in dense-canopy ravine habitats with high moisture and low solar exposure, resulting in a patchy distribution of abundance. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect the physiological constraints of Plethodontid salamanders. Furthermore, demographic cohorts were not uniformly distributed among occupied plots on the landscape. The probability of gravid female occurrence was nearly uniform among occupied plots, but juveniles were much more likely to occur on plots with lower surface temperatures. The disconnect between reproductive effort and recruitment suggests that survival differs across the landscape and that local population dynamics vary spatially. Our study demonstrates a connection between abundance, fine-scale environmental gradients, and population dynamics, providing a foundation for future research concerning movement, population connectivity, and physiology.},

abstract = {Tip-up mounds, pits, and other microsites created by hurricanes may promote diversity in many forests by providing opportunities for different species to regenerate. To see if we could detect differences in microsite preference among closely related species, we studied the regeneration of three sympatric Betula species on five types of microsites on experimental mound-pit complexes. Microsites were created by pulling down canopy trees to simulate damage from past hurricanes in southern New England. Seeds were collected in litter traps and experimentally released over mounds and pits to determine effects of microtopography on fine-scale dispersal patterns. The fate of naturally germinating seedlings was monitored on the disturbed site, and seedlings were also transplanted onto microsites to examine growth patterns, causes of mortality, and leaf-level physiology. Seed rain onto the disturbed site was abundant and spatially heterogeneous because of scattered residual canopy trees and surviving uprooted trees. Seeds tended to disperse away from vertically oriented surfaces of mounds and to accumulate in pits. Most seedlings germinated on scarified level areas rather than on mounds or in pits, but mounds became more favorable for germination the second year following disturbance. Two fundamentally different types of mortality were observed in transplanted seedlings. Extrinsic factors such as frost heaving, burial by soil and litter, and browsing were dominant on some microsites. Mortality due to these factors occurred primarily during the winter and was unrelated to seedling size. On other microsites, resource limitation (low light levels and lack of water or nutrients) was the major cause of death. Small seedlings were most susceptible to mortality on these microsites, and most deaths occurred during the growing season. White birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) exhibited the fastest growth and most flexible photosynthetic response to changing light levels but suffered greatest mortality on shaded microsites. Black birch (B. lenta L.) showed increased leaf area ratio in shaded conditions. Yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis Britt.) was least flexible and grew more slowly than the other species but was best able to survive on shaded microsites. All species attained maximum growth on tip-up mounds. After three growing seasons, the tallest seedlings reached nearly 3 m above the forest floor, enabling us to predict which individuals would ultimately reach the canopy to complete the regeneration process.},

Such distributions play an important role in statistical inference (for example as prior distributions in a Bayesian analysis) and in evidence-based decision-making (for example as expressions of uncertainty regarding inputs to a decision model). This article sets out a number of practices through which elicitation can be made as rigorous and scientific as possible. One such practice is to follow a recognized protocol that is designed to address and minimize the cognitive biases that experts are prone to when making probabilistic judgments.

Larval amphibians-spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), small-mouthed salamander (A. texanum), and American toad (Bufo americanus)-were added to artificial pools in four dispersal arrays on forest edges. Each array consisted of a pool surrounded by a circular drift fence with pitfall traps and two 2.5 x 50 m enclosures (runs) extending into forest and old-field habitat. Juveniles captured at the circular fences were individually marked and released into either field or forest runs. We determined initial distance, initial rate, total distance, and net distance moved by juveniles in the field versus forest from recaptures in the runs. We also conducted 24-hour dehydration trials to compare the rates of evaporative water loss by spotted and small-mouthed salamanders in field and forest. Initial orientation of spotted salamanders and toads was significantly biased toward forest. Orientation of small-mouthed salamanders did not differ significantly from random expectations. The avoidance of open-canopy habitat by juvenile American toads in particular indicates that predictions of dispersal behavior based on adult habitat use may be misleading. Spotted salamanders moved almost four times farther and toads more than three times farther into the forest than into the field, and recapture rates of both species were much lower in the field. We attribute the lower recapture rates and shorter distances moved in the field to higher mortality due to desiccation or an abundance of predators. Juvenile spotted and small-mouthed salamanders experienced greater evaporative water loss in the field. Our data on movement behavior and dehydration rates suggest that old-field habitats offer greater landscape resistance to dispersing juveniles of some species. Thus, forest fragmentation is likely to reduce dispersal rates between local populations of these three species, with potentially negative consequences for population persistence in altered landscapes.},

Amphibians - including Spotted Salamanders, Small-mouth Salamanders, and American Toads - were significantly more likely to emigrate to forests than fields upon emerging from the experimental pools. Once in either habitat, individuals in forests were found to disperse further and more frequently than individuals in the field. Dispersal distance and movement patterns is not necessarily an explanation of habitat favorability. However, behavioral avoidance and higher mortality rates make explain reduced movements, particularly when environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation) are favorable for movement. This study is unique in that it explored possible biological mechanisms determining movement and mortality in different environments - dessication risk. The researchers recorded significantly faster dehydration rates in juvenile amphibians in field environments. This paired with likely higher predation risks in fields over forests may explain behavioral differences between the two types of environments. This was an influential and well designed study to expand on amphibian dispersal patterns in different habitats.},

abstract = {N-mixture models describe count data replicated in time and across sites in terms of abundance N and detectabil-ity p. They are popular because they allow inference about N while controlling for factors that influence p without the need for marking animals. Using a capture–recapture perspective, we show that the loss of information that results from not marking animals is critical, making reliable statistical modeling of N and p problematic using just count data. One cannot reliably fit a model in which the detection probabilities are distinct among repeat visits as this model is over-specified. This makes uncontrolled variation in p problematic. By counter example, we show that even if p is constant after adjusting for covariate effects (the " constant p " assumption) scientifically plausible alternative models in which N (or its expectation) is non-identifiable or does not even exist as a parameter, lead to data that are practically indistinguish-able from data generated under an N-mixture model. This is particularly the case for sparse data as is commonly seen in applications. We conclude that under the constant p assumption reliable inference is only possible for relative abundance in the absence of questionable and/or untestable assumptions or with better quality data than seen in typical applica-tions. Relative abundance models for counts can be readily fitted using Poisson regression in standard software such as R and are sufficiently flexible to allow controlling for p through the use covariates while simultaneously modeling variation in relative abundance. If users require estimates of absolute abundance, they should collect auxiliary data that help with estimation of p. 1. Introduction Strategies for inference about abundance N from count data under imperfect detection include: (i) capture–recapture mod-eling in which auxiliary data supplement the counts in order to allow direct inference about detection rates p; (ii) N-mixture modelling in which no such auxiliary data are col-lected but instead the model is structured in order to allow inference about N and p (which is assumed constant after con-trolling for covariates, hereafter, " constant p "); or (iii) index models in which inference is made about relative abundance assuming constant p. N-mixture models were developed by Royle (2004) as an alternative to estimating abundance using tools such as capture–recapture that can be difficult, expensive, and impractical (Royle, 2004; Dennis et al., 2015). They are popular among field biologists and the original model of Royle (2004) has been extended, for example, to model zero-inflation, extra-Poisson variation in abundance, and to relax the assumption of population closure between visits (see D{\'{e}}nes et al., 2015, for a recent review). The idea that we can estimate both N and p without marking animals seems appealing. However, this economy of field effort imposes a cost on the analysis. Recaptures of marked animals provide auxiliary data for estimation of p; we can model these data in terms of p without reference to N. In N-mixture modeling, we do not have such auxiliary data and instead rely on the constant p assumption along with a specific choice of hierarchical model on N to ensure identifiability. In choosing among competing methodologies, it is impor-tant that users are fully-informed about comparative weaknesses and strengths of different approaches. Here, we describe the N-mixture model and highlight the information loss that makes reliable statistical modeling of N and p prob-lematic using count data alone.},

abstract = {American chestnut (Castanea dentata [Marsh.] Borkh.) dominated the eastern forests of North America, serving as a keystone species both ecologically and economically until the introduction of the chestnut blight, Cryphonectria parasitica, functionally eradicated the species. Restoration efforts include genetic transformation utilizing genes such as oxalate oxidase to produce potentially blight-resistant chestnut trees that could be released back into the native range. However, before such a release can be undertaken, it is necessary to assess nontarget impacts. Since oxalate oxidase is meant to combat a fungal pathogen, we are particularly interested in potential impacts of this transgene on beneficial fungi. This study compares ectomycorrhizal fungal colonization on a transgenic American chestnut clone expressing enhanced blight resistance to a wild-type American chestnut, a conventionally bred American-Chinese hybrid chestnut, and other Fagaceae species. A greenhouse bioassay used soil from two field sites with different soil types and land use histories. The number of colonized root tips was counted, and fungal species were identified using morphology, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and DNA sequencing. Results showed that total ectomycorrhizal colonization varied more by soil type than by tree species. Individual fungal species varied in their colonization rates, but there were no significant differences between colonization on transgenic and wild-type chestnuts. This study shows that the oxalate oxidase gene can increase resistance against Cryphonectria parasitica without changing the colonization rate for ectomycorrhizal species. These findings will be crucial for a potential deregulation of blight-resistant American chestnuts containing the oxalate oxidase gene.},

abstract = {Changes to landscapes for agricultural activities often result in reduction and fragmentation of forested habitat. Land conversion for cattle ranching in south-central Florida has resulted in increases in pasture land interspersed with remnant patches of hardwood hammock. To examine the importance of these hammocks to anurans, we sampled 78 seasonally inundated wetlands to examine the relative importance of proximity of hardwood hammock patches ({\textgreater} 20 ha) and wetland characteristics and used generalized linear models to determine which factors had a significant effect on larval anuran species richness or abundance. Species richness was significantly influenced by pH, conductivity, and water depth. Proximity to hammock did not influence species richness; however, assemblage composition differed between wetlands near hammocks and wetlands surrounded by pasture. Barking treefrogs (Hyla gratiosa LeConte, 1856), pine woods treefrogs (Hyla femoralis Bose in Daudin, 1800), and oak toads (Bufo quercicus Holbrook, 1840) bred only in wetlands within 20, 50, and 200 m of hammocks, respectively. Factors influencing tadpole abundances were species-specific. Retention of seasonally inundated wetlands proximal to large hammocks on ranchlands can provide important habitat for supporting a diverse assemblage of anurans.},

abstract = {Understanding patterns of microhabitat use among terrestrial salamanders is important for predicting their responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The dependence of terrestrial salamanders on cutaneous respiration limits their spatial distribution to moist, humid areas. Although many studies have shown negative effects of canopy removal on terrestrial salamander abundance, some have shown potential ameliorating effects of retaining coarse woody debris (CWD) as moist refugia (critical resources in the landscape). Because cover objects like CWD retain moisture longer than fine debris, terrestrial salamanders are often more locally abundant in areas of dense cover. Temporally variable environmental conditions could affect microhabitat quality and influence the fine-scale spatial distributions of salamanders. Spatial and temporal variability in microhabitat use greatly influence individual detectability, which is always a challenge for terrestrial salamanders. We conducted repeated area-constrained surveys to examine variation in salamander microhabitat use of terrestrial salamanders in relation to season, year, and weather conditions. We found that time since rain (TSR) was the best predictor of relative salamander microhabitat use, but the strength of this relationship varied among years. In addition, TSR was also the best predictor of salamander surface activity. We captured most salamanders within leaf litter, but the proportion of leaf litter captures varied with TSR. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for variable detectability when sampling for terrestrial salamanders. Disturbances which affect leaf litter depth and decomposition rates could influence the availability and quality of microhabitats and potentially increase competition among individuals for natural cover objects.},

@article{Hughes1994,
abstract = {A field study was conducted at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (USA) to quantify changes in the mass, chemistry and timing of litterfall during stand development of the northern hardwood forest and to relate changes to other ecologically meaningful forest dynamics. Leaf fall on three contiguous watersheds, harvested 1, 15 and 66 years ago, was measured with litter traps from 1984 to 1988. Woodfall into the 15-year-old stand was monitored on permanent plots. During the first 17 years of forest development, fallen leaves and wood of Prunus pensylvanica accounted for 32-59{\%} and more than 97{\%}, respectively, of total mass litter inputs. In the older forest, Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Betula alleghaniensis contributed 53{\%}, 25{\%}, and 21{\%}, respectively, of the total leaf fall mass of the stand. Changes in the leaf mass of each species during forest development were the result of an increased number of leaves rather than increased mass per leaf. Leaves fell first in the oldest stand and last in the youngest stand. The nitrogen (N) content and non-structural carbohydrates of fallen leaves were highest in the youngest stand, but there was no overall trend in later stages of forest development. In 1985, leaves of all species in all stands had significantly reduced N contents (only 23-80{\%} of N in leaves falling in 1984). In the oldest stand, this difference resulted in leaf fall N of 30.3 kg ha-1(1984) and only 15.6 kg ha-1(1985). Leaves of different species varied considerably in organic fractions but, with few exceptions, cellulose and lignin were significantly higher in 1985 than in 1984. The large difference between 1984 and 1985 in organic fractions and N suggests that leaf litter quality may vary greatly from year to year and may partially account for unbalanced nitrogen budgets. Large pulses of wood fell each year into the mid-aged stand (1151-1283 kg ha-1year-1). This woodfall, high in lignin (28-31{\%}) but low in nitrogen (0.1-0.2{\%}), supplemented leaf fall and yielded total litterfall lignin: nitrogen ratios of 18.9 (1984) and 30.8 (1985). The timing of this deposition coincides with a transition to accretion of forest floor biomass from a protracted decline following disturbance. Apparently, the combined effects of high litterfall and low substrate quality lead to a sustained accumulation of the forest floor until a steady state is reached, about 50 years after disturbance.},

abstract = {Aim: This study uses the combination of presettlement tree surveys and spatial analysis to produce an empirical reconstruction of tree species abundance and vegetation units at different scales in the original landscape. Location: The New England study area extends across eight physiographic sections, from the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Coastal Plain, The data are drawn from 389 original towns in what are now seven states in the north-eastern United States. These towns have early land division records which document the witness trees growing in the town before European settlement (c. seventeenth to eighteenth century AD). Methods: Records of witness trees from presettlement surveys were collated from towns throughout the study area (1.3 × 105 km2). Tree abundance was averaged over townwide samples of multiple forest types, integrating proportions of taxa at a local scale (102 km2). These data were summarized into genus groups over the sample towns, which were then mapped [geographical information system (GIS)], classified (Cluster Analysis) and ordinated [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)]. Modern climatic and topographic variables were also derived from GIS analyses for each town and all town attributes were quantitatively compared. Distributions of both individual species and vegetation units were analysed and displayed for spatial analysis of vegetation structure. Results: The tally of 153,932 individual tree citations show a dominant latitudinal trend in the vegetation. Spatial patterns are concisely displayed as pie charts of genus composition arrayed on sampled towns. Detailed interpolated frequency surfaces show spatial patterns of range and abundance of the dominant taxa. Oak, spruce, hickory and chestnut reach distinctive range limits within the study area. Eight vegetation clusters are distinguished. The northern vegetation is a continuous geographical sequence typified by beech while the southern vegetation is an amorphous group typified by oak. Main conclusions: The wealth of information recorded in the New England town presettlement surveys is an ideal data base to elucidate the natural patterns of vegetation over an extensive spatial area. The timing, town-wide scale, expansive coverage, quantitative enumeration and unbiased estimates are critical advantages of proprietor lotting surveys in determining original tree distributions. This historical-geographical approach produces a vivid reconstruction of the natural vegetation and species distributions as portrayed on maps. The spatial, vegetational and environmental patterns all demonstrate a distinct 'tension zone' separating 'northern hardwood' and 'central hardwood' towns, The presettlement northern hardwood forests, absolutely dominated by beech, forms a continuum responding to a complex climatic gradient of altitude and latitude, The oak forests to the south are distinguished by non-zonal units, probably affected by fire. Although at the continental scale, the forests seem to be a broad transition, at a finer scale they respond to topography such as the major valleys or the northern mountains. This study resets some preconceptions about the original forest, such as the overestimation of the role of pine, hemlock and chestnut and the underestimation of the distinctiveness of the tension zone. Most importantly, the forests of the past and their empirical description provide a basis for many ecological, educational and management applications today.},

abstract = {European and American chestnut species (Castanea) have been decimated by exotic species, most notably chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica), since the early nineteenth century. Backcross breeding programs that transfer blight disease resistance from Chinese chestnut (C. mollissima) into American chestnut (C. dentata) offer promise for chestnut restoration, particularly for the American chestnut which was a keystone species in eastern North America. Nursery prescriptions and conformity to desired American chestnut traits following planting must be tested, however, before blight resistance can even be evaluated. We tested early field performance of American and Chinese chestnut and hybrid seedlings from the third backcross generation (e.g., BC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) in two-aged regeneration harvests on highly productive sites in the southern Appalachians, USA. We also tested a common nursery prescription of grading seedlings by size prior to planting. BC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} seedlings had similar 4-year survival to American chestnut seedlings, but generally had smaller stem heights and ground-line diameters (GLD). Although blight had not yet substantially challenged some sites, the BC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} seedlings had blight incidence similar to the Chinese chestnut which was lower than the American chestnut. Visual seedling grading affected planting shock and stem height and GLD by the end of year 4. Large size-class seedlings had more stem dieback and 5 {\%} lower survival compared to small size-class seedlings, but larger trees exhibited the same height in year 3 as small trees in year 4. Advanced breeding material (BC{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}F{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) was successfully established during the stand initiation phase of forest development on highly productive sites, but deviations in desired growth rate of the American chestnut was evident. Visual grading of seedlings affected establishment of breeding material, and should be considered in the restoration process.},

abstract = {Europe has the world's most extensive network of conservation areas. Conservation areas are selected without taking into account the effects of climate change. How effectively would such areas conserve biodiversity under climate change? We assess the effectiveness of protected areas and the Natura 2000 network in conserving a large proportion of European plant and terrestrial vertebrate species under climate change. We found that by 2080, 58±2.6{\%} of the species would lose suitable climate in protected areas, whereas losses affected 63±2.1{\%} of the species of European concern occurring in Natura 2000 areas. Protected areas are expected to retain climatic suitability for species better than unprotected areas (P{\textless}0.001), but Natura 2000 areas retain climate suitability for species no better and sometimes less effectively than unprotected areas. The risk is high that ongoing efforts to conserve Europe's biodiversity are jeopardized by climate change. New policies are required to avert this risk. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Ecological stoichiometry (ES) uses elemental ratios and mass balance to explain organismal growth, an important parameter in ecological systems. In this study, we tested quantitative predictions of the ES ?minimal model? for the growth rates of two tadpole species (wood frogs, Lithobates sylvaticus and American toads, Anaxyrus americanus), by manipulating light and the quality of a leaf litter mixture in a seminatural mesocosm experiment. We predicted that wood frogs, which consume leaf litter as a resource, would respond more strongly to leaf litter quality than toads, which forage on periphyton and algae. The ES minimal model, parameterized from literature values, provided strikingly accurate quantitative predictions of nonlinear wood frog growth patterns across gradients of leaf litter quality, both in this experiment and when applied to previously published data on wood frog growth responses to various leaf litter species. In contrast, toad growth was best explained by the biomass of periphyton, which was driven primarily by light availability and only indirectly influenced by litter-derived soluble polyphenols. This study demonstrates the power of ES to predict organism growth rates, and highlights potential applications of this theory to predicting population- and community-level responses to changing forest environments.},

abstract = {The extinction of large herbivores, often keystone species, can dramatically modify plant communities and impose key biotic thresholds that may prevent an ecosystem returning to its previous state and threaten native biodiversity. A potentially innovative, yet controversial, landscape-based long-term restoration approach is to replace missing plant-herbivore interactions with non-native herbivores. Aldabran giant (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and Madagascan radiated (Astrochelys radiata) tortoises, taxonomically and functionally similar to the extinct Mauritian giant tortoises (Cylindraspis spp.), were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius, in 2007 to control the non-native plants that were threatening persistence of native species. We monitored the response of the plant community to tortoise grazing for 11 months in enclosures before the tortoises were released and, compared the cost of using tortoises as weeders with the cost of using manual labor. At the end of this period, plant biomass; vegetation height and cover; and adult, seedling, flower, and seed abundance were 3-136 times greater in adjacent control plots than in the tortoise enclosures. After their release, the free-roaming tortoises grazed on most non-native plants and significantly reduced vegetation cover, height, and seed production, reflecting findings from the enclosure study. The tortoises generally did not eat native species, although they consumed those native species that increased in abundance following the eradication of mammalian herbivores. Our results suggest that introduced non-native tortoises are a more cost-effective approach to control non-native vegetation than manual weeding. Numerous long-term outcomes (e.g., change in species composition and soil seed bank) are possible following tortoise releases. Monitoring and adaptive management are needed to ensure that the replacement herbivores promote the recovery of native plants. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.},

Catches of salamanders from plots in mature forest stands were about five times higher than those on recent clearcuts. Almost all species and major taxonomic groups of salamanders were adversely affected by timber removal. Mean number of species collected per plot was about twice as great in mature forest stands as in clearcuts. Analyses of stand age versus salamander catch for 47 plots indicate that 50-70 years are required for populations to return to predisturbance levels following cutting. We conservatively estimate that clearcutting on U.S national forest in western North Carolina results in a loss of nearly 14 million salamanders annually. It also is chronically reducing regional populations by more than a quarter of a billion salamanders (9{\%}) below that which could be sustained if mature forests were not cut.},

Roadkills are a premier mortality source, yet except for local spots, rates rarely limit population size. Road avoidance, especially due to traffic noise, has a greater ecological impact. The still-more-important barrier effect subdivides populations, with demographic and probably genetic consequences. Road networks crossing landscapes cause local hydrologic and erosion effects, whereas stream networks and distant valleys receive major peak-flow and sediment impacts. Chemical effects mainly occur near roads. Road networks interrupt horizontal ecological flows, alter landscape spatial pattern, and therefore inhibit important interior species. Thus, road density and network structure are informative landscape ecology assays. Australia has huge road-reserve networks of native vegetation, whereas the Dutch have tunnels and overpasses perforating road barriers to enhance ecological flows. Based on road-effect zones, an estimated 15-20{\%} of the United States is ecologically impacted by roads.},

During summer 2004, we re-examined I I restorations to determine how their plant communities had changed since 1992. In addition, we re-evaluated waterfowl and anuran communities at eight restorations. Because 1992 data were compiled from separate studies, all three groups of organisms were simultaneously examined at only two wetlands. Significant decreases in plant diversity and plant species richness were detected between 1992 and 2004, while significant increases were detected for species classified as obligate or facultative wet. These changes suggest that the plant communities at the restorations have matured since 1992. Use of the wetlands by waterfowl and anurans, on the other hand, did not exhibit significant change over this period. Regular monitoring of restorations over even longer periods will provide new insights into the way in which restored communities develop and whether current restoration methods have succeeded in establishing stable, species-rich wetland communities.},

Part of the reason for this is the persistence of the myth that observation of p {\textless} 0.05 is sufficient justification to claim that you have made a discovery. It is hopeless to expect users to change their reliance on p-values unless they are offered an alternative way of judging the reliability of their conclusions. If the alternative method is to have a chance of being adopted widely, it will have to be easy to understand and to calculate. One such proposal is based on calculation of false positive risk(FPR). It is suggested that p-values and confidence intervals should continue to be given, but that they should be supplemented by a single additional number that conveys the strength of the evidence better than the p-value. This number could be the minimum FPR (that calculated on the assumption of a prior probability of 0.5, the largest value that can be assumed in the absence of hard prior data). Alternatively one could specify the prior probability that it would be necessary to believe in order to achieve an FPR of, say, 0.05. ARTICLE HISTORY},

abstract = {The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is the second largest boreal wetland ecosystem in the world and an important natural source of global atmospheric methane. We quantify the HBL methane emissions by using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to simulate aircraft measurements over the HBL from the ARCTAS and pre-HIPPO campaigns in May-July 2008, together with continuous 2004-2008 surface observations at Fraserdale (southern edge of HBL) and Alert (Arctic background). The difference in methane concentrations between Fraserdale and Alert is shown to be a good indicator of HBL emissions, and implies a sharp seasonal onset of emissions in late May (consistent with the aircraft data), a peak in July-August, and a seasonal shut-off in September. The model, in which seasonal variation of emission is mainly driven by surface temperature, reproduces well the observations in summer but its seasonal shoulders are too broad. We suggest that this reflects the suppression of emissions by snow cover and greatly improve the model simulation by accounting for this effect. Our resulting best estimate for HBL methane emissions is 2.3 Tg/a, several-fold higher than previous estimates (Roulet et al., 1994; Worthy et al., 2000).},

abstract = {Northern peatlands are a large repository of atmospheric carbon due to an imbalance between primary production by plants and microbial decomposition. The James Bay Lowlands (JBL) of northern Ontario are a large peatland-complex but remain relatively unstudied. Climate change models predict the region will experience warmer and drier conditions, potentially altering plant community composition, and shifting the region from a long-term carbon sink to a source. We collected a peat core from two geographically separated (ca. 200 km) ombrotrophic peatlands (Victor and Kinoje Bogs) and one minerotrophic peatland (Victor Fen) located near Victor Bog within the JBL. We characterized (i) archaeal, bacterial, and fungal community structure with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of ribosomal DNA, (ii) estimated microbial activity using community level physiological profiling and extracellular enzymes activities, and (iii) the aeration and temperature dependence of carbon mineralization at three depths (0-10, 50-60, and 100-110 cm) from each site. Similar dominant microbial taxa were observed at all three peatlands despite differences in nutrient content and substrate quality. In contrast, we observed differences in basal respiration, enzyme activity, and the magnitude of substrate utilization, which were all generally higher at Victor Fen and similar between the two bogs. However, there was no preferential mineralization of carbon substrates between the bogs and fens. Microbial community composition did not correlate with measures of microbial activity but pH was a strong predictor of activity across all sites and depths. Increased peat temperature and aeration stimulated CO(2) production but this did not correlate with a change in enzyme activities. Potential microbial activity in the JBL appears to be influenced by the quality of the peat substrate and the presence of microbial inhibitors, which suggests the existing peat substrate will have a large influence on future JBL carbon dynamics.},

Recent studies suggest that facilitation, in which litter is processed by a succession of species with differing abilities and requirements, may be important in making the nutrients bound in litter available to the stream assemblage.2. We predicted that stream invertebrates that feed on terrestrial leaf litter (shredders) and tadpoles would facilitate leaf litter decomposition by changing the quality of leaf material directly via physical contact or indirectly via nutrient release. We experimentally examined the ability of shredders and tadpoles to break down leaves, independently and together, in artificial streams beside a natural forest stream.3. The decomposition rate was greater when shredders and tadpoles were together than was expected from rates in single-species treatments, indicating that facilitation occurred. This facilitation operated in one direction only: the rate of leaf breakdown by tadpoles was higher when leaves had been partly processed by shredders, but there was no similar effect when leaves previously occupied by tadpoles were processed by shredders. We did not detect facilitation caused by indirect nutrient release.4. Shredders may have benefited tadpoles by roughening leaf surfaces, making them easier for the tadpoles to consume and enhancing leaf breakdown in the presence of both taxa. This indicates that the loss of a single species can have impacts on ecosystem functioning that go beyond the loss of its direct contribution.},

abstract = {Of the threats facing amphibian populations today, habitat transformation resulting from land use is among the most pressing. Although conservation of pond-breeding salamanders clearly requires protection of breeding ponds and their surrounding habitat, little is known about the effects of land use and other factors on the occurrence of salamanders in the dispersal/terrestrial phase of their life cycle. To determine these effects, we surveyed populations of Eastern Newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) at 551 stations across Vermont and modeled salamander distribution as a function of environmental variables hypothesized to influence site occupancy. We developed a set of 12 models based on seven a priori hypotheses of site occupancy. We hypothesized that occupancy was influenced by (1) amounts of available habitat types, (2) arrangement of these habitat types, (3) geographic position, (4) housing density, (5) road density, (6) short-term changes in habitat distribution, or (7) habitat structure at the stand level. We used a single-season occupancy model to rank and compare the 12 models. A total of 232 Eastern Newts was detected at 82 of 551 stations. Of the 12 models, amount of habitat within 0.5 km of the survey station best represented the field data. Strong effects were indicated for developed land (-), open water (+), and forest (+) cover. Given a survey station with average forest and open water characteristics, stations with {\textgreater}5{\%} developed land classes within a 0.5-km buffer had a very low probability of occupancy. Further research is needed to determine the direct role of development on occupancy patterns.},

These may include ultraviolet radiation, predation, habi- tat modification, environmental acidity and toxicants, diseases, changes in climate or weather patterns, and interactions among these factors. Understanding the extent of the problem and its nature requires an understanding of how local factors affect the dynamics of local populations. Hypotheses about population behavior must be tested against appropriate null hypotheses. We generated null hypotheses for the be- havior of amphibian populations using a model, and we used them to test hypotheses about the behavior of 85 time series taken from the literature. Our results suggest that most amphibian populations should decrease more often than they increase, due to highly variable recruitment and less variable adult mortality. During the period covered by our data (1951-1997), more amphibian populations decreased than our model predicted. However, there was no indication that the proportion of populations decreasing changed over time. In addition, our review of the literature suggests that many if not most amphibians exist in metapopulations. Understanding the dynamics of amphibian populations will require an integration of studies on and within local populations and at the metapopulation level.},

A cost-benefit analysis of those ecosystems richest in species diversity, i.e. tropical rainforests, leads to the conclusion that non-use values often outweigh the values of conventional uses (clear-cutting, pasture, etc.), but are hardly considered in development decisions. Therefore, tourism and its high direct use value can play an important role as an incentive for protection. As tourism causes significant emissions, e;g. by flying, the concept of Environmental Damage Costs is introduced and integrated into the calculations. Further, international tourism development is analyzed and related to protection goals. Visitation rates of sensitive areas need to be limited; education, management, and control measures have to be integrated; and the proportion of money captured from tourists has to be increased. In the long run, tourism needs to undergo substantial changes.},

To test the applicability of this model in a natural dispersal situation, seeds of Betula lenta were collected downwind of a population along transects which trapped seeds (a) after primary dispersal through the air, and (b) after primary aerial dispersal plus secondary dispersal across a snow cover. In order to examine mechanisms of seed flight, weights of 296 seeds were experimentally modified and duration and distance of seed flight measured in laboratory trials. Rate of descent of modified seeds depended strongly on individual seed weight and wing loading, and lateral movement in a horizontal airstream was determined by rate of descent, as predicted. In the field, however, distance traveled by aerial movement was only weakly linked to seed size and weight, and the relationship did not hold during secondary dispersal near the ground. Thus, seed size and weight are not the principal factors controlling seed movement under all conditions. It may bc necessary to invoke models based on airstream turbulence.},

abstract = {We used an experimental approach to investigate the effects of landscape composition on the initial dispersal success of juvenile amphibians. Larval amphibians-spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), small-mouthed salamander (A. texanum), and American toad (Bufo americanus)-were added to artificial pools in four dispersal arrays on forest edges. Each array consisted of a pool surrounded by a circular drift fence with pitfall traps and two 2.5 x 50 m enclosures (runs) extending into forest and old-field habitat. Juveniles captured at the circular fences were individually marked and released into either field or forest runs. We determined initial distance, initial rate, total distance, and net distance moved by juveniles in the field versus forest from recaptures in the runs. We also conducted 24-hour dehydration trials to compare the rates of evaporative water loss by spotted and small-mouthed salamanders in field and forest. Initial orientation of spotted salamanders and toads was significantly biased toward forest. Orientation of small-mouthed salamanders did not differ significantly from random expectations. The avoidance of open-canopy habitat by juvenile American toads in particular indicates that predictions of dispersal behavior based on adult habitat use may be misleading. Spotted salamanders moved almost four times farther and toads more than three times farther into the forest than into the field, and recapture rates of both species were much lower in the field. We attribute the lower recapture rates and shorter distances moved in the field to higher mortality due to desiccation or an abundance of predators. Juvenile spotted and small-mouthed salamanders experienced greater evaporative water loss in the field. Our data on movement behavior and dehydration rates suggest that old-field habitats offer greater landscape resistance to dispersing juveniles of some species. Thus, forest fragmentation is likely to reduce dispersal rates between local populations of these three species, with potentially negative consequences for population persistence in altered landscapes.},
annote = {Study of pool-breeding amphibian dispersal and dessication patterns in forested and field habitats. Amphibians - including Spotted Salamanders, Small-mouth Salamanders, and American Toads - were significantly more likely to emigrate to forests than fields upon emerging from the experimental pools. Once in either habitat, individuals in forests were found to disperse further and more frequently than individuals in the field. Dispersal distance and movement patterns is not necessarily an explanation of habitat favorability. However, behavioral avoidance and higher mortality rates make explain reduced movements, particularly when environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation) are favorable for movement. This study is unique in that it explored possible biological mechanisms determining movement and mortality in different environments - dessication risk. The researchers recorded significantly faster dehydration rates in juvenile amphibians in field environments. This paired with likely higher predation risks in fields over forests may explain behavioral differences between the two types of environments. This was an influential and well designed study to expand on amphibian dispersal patterns in different habitats.},

We introduce the basic ideas of MCMC and software BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling), stressing that a simple and satisfactory intuition for MCMC does not require extraordinary mathematical sophistication. We illustrate the use of MCMC with an analysis of the association between latent factors governing individual heterogeneity in breeding and survival rates of kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla).

We report the first evidence from palaeoecological records of coprophilous fungal spores of the formerly more extensive geographical range of giant tortoises in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island. Upland tortoise populations on Santa Cruz declined 500-700 years ago, likely the result of human impact or possible climatic change.

abstract = {Aim In a selected literature survey we reviewed studies on the habitat heterogeneity–animal species diversity relationship and evaluated whether there are uncertainties and biases in its empirical support. Location World-wide. Methods We reviewed 85 publications for the period 1960–2003. We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study. Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to ‘keystone structures' that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

In all analyses we corrected for habitat variables concerning the pool. Significant effects of pool size were found for old pools only. In both old and new pools species number turned out to be positively influenced by the vicinity of a wood. Woodland is considered here as an element increasing the connectivity of a landscape and as a part of the land habitat of amphibians.

Current methods for identifying potential vernal pools are primarily based on visual interpretation and digitization of aerial photographs, with variable accuracy and low repeatability. In this paper, we present an effective and efficient method for detecting and mapping potential vernal pools using stochastic depression analysis with additional geospatial analysis. Our method was designed to take advantage of high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, which are becoming increasingly available, though not yet frequently employed in vernal pool studies. We successfully detected more than 2000 potential vernal pools in a {\~{}}150 km2 study area in eastern Massachusetts. The accuracy assessment in our study indicated that the commission rates ranged from 2.5{\%} to 6.0{\%}, while the proxy omission rate was 8.2{\%}, rates that are much lower than reported errors of previous vernal pool studies conducted in the northeastern United States. One significant advantage of our semi-automated approach for vernal pool identification is that it may reduce inconsistencies and alleviate repeatability concerns associated with manual photointerpretation methods. Another strength of our strategy is that, in addition to detecting the point-based vernal pool locations for the inventory, the boundaries of vernal pools can be extracted as polygon features to characterize their geometric properties, which are not available in the current statewide vernal pool databases in Massachusetts},

abstract = {Drought represents a significant stressor to aquatic animals. However, empirical data regarding the response of many aquatic animals, particularly amphibians, to drought are limited. The southeastern United States experienced a supraseasonal drought in 2007-2008, which provided an opportunity to examine the resistance and resilience of salamanders to drought. In this study, we used 5 yr of presence-absence data at 17 first-order streams and 61 mo of mark-recapture data at one stream to examine the effects of drought on occupancy and vital rates of the salamander Desmognathus fuscus (Northern Dusky Salamander). We tested three hypotheses regarding the effects of drought: larvae would decrease in occupancy during drought conditions, but adult occupancy would remain stable; adult temporary emigration rates would be greatest during supraseasonal drought conditions; and adult survivorship would be equal or nearly equal during nondrought conditions and drought conditions due to higher rates of temporary emigration. We found that adult salamander occupancy remained stable through the 5 yr of sampling; however, larval salamander occupancy decreased by an average of 30{\%} during the supraseasonal drought. We found that adult temporary emigration probabilities were twice as high during supraseasonal drought conditions than during nondrought or typical drought conditions. Monthly survival of adults was relatively high during nondrought (S = 0.89 ± 0.02), typical drought (S = 0.97 ± 0.02), and severe drought conditions (S = 0.90 ± 0.01). Our findings suggest that high survivorship of adult D. fuscus likely buffers the negative effects of drought on larvae and high rates of temporary emigration allow adult salamanders to be resilient to supraseasonal drought conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The Herpetologists League, Inc.},

abstract = {Peatlands, which are dominant features of the Canadian landscape, cover approximately 1.136??million??km2, or 12{\%} of the land area. Most of the peatlands (97{\%}) occur in the Boreal Wetland Region (64{\%}) and Subarctic Wetland Region (33{\%}). Because of the large area they cover and their high organic carbon content, these peatlands contain approximately 147??Gt soil carbon, which is about 56{\%} of the organic carbon stored in all Canadian soils. A model for estimating peatland sensitivity to climate warming was used to determine both the sensitivity ratings of various peatland areas and the associated organic carbon masses. Calculations show that approximately 60{\%} of the total area of Canadian peatlands and 51{\%} of the organic carbon mass in all Canadian peatlands is expected to be severely to extremely severely affected by climate change. The increase in average annual air temperature of 3-5????C over land and 5-7????C over the oceans predicted for northern Canada by the end of this century would result in the degradation of frozen peatlands in the Subarctic and northern Boreal wetland regions and severe drying in the southern Boreal Wetland Region. In addition, flooding of coastal peatlands is expected because of the predicted rise in sea levels. As a result of these changes, a large part of the carbon in the peatlands expected to be severely and extremely severely affected by climate change could be released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which will further increase climate warming. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

- drying of southern boreal wetlands
- flooding of coastal peat

Previous work: Various studies have predicted CC impacts to Canadian peat: 
- (1) hydrological changes and more wildfires (Hengeveld 2000), 
- (2) increased decomposition of org (ACAI 2004), and 
- (3) changes to plant communities, more peat accumulation in Arctic, loss of permafrost (Gorham 1991 and Zoltai 1994)

NWWG definition of peatlands - wetlands containing more than 40cm peat

Layer Table of Peatlands Canada Database (Tarnocai et al. 2005) to obtain organic carbon content of peat calculations (derived from peat cores)

Greatest impact to Canadian peatlands will be in the subarctic wetland region (i.e. HBL)

Effect (emissions vs sequestration) depends on two primary variables: (1) if the peat is frozen or unfrozen and (2) if warming causes peatland to become wetter or dryer (Figure 9)
- seems like most of the HBL is in the Subarctic Wetland Region and thus frozen and expected to thaw, become saturated, and experience more anaerobic decomp resulting in methane release
- peatlands in the southern Boreal Wetland Region expected to get dryer and experience more wildfire},

abstract = {Developing spatially explicit models of Ecosystem Services (ES) distribution and diversity across the territory has been increasingly attracting the interest of researchers and policy-makers due to its potential to operacionalize and mainstream the ES concept into existing planning and policy tools. In this paper we explore the use of social media photographs to model the spatial distribution of people preferences for cultural ecosystem services (CES), map their hotspots, identify the determinant variables as well as the spatial correlation between CES. This research was applied in the Sudoeste Alentejano and Costa Vicentina Natural Park (PNSACV) located in Southwestern Alentejo, Portugal. A collection of 1378 geo-tagged digital images taken inside the Park and posted in the Flickr web platform between 2004 and 2015 were analyzed and classified according to a tailored list of CES. To model CES spatial distribution it was used a species distribution model – Maxent – adapted to combine the observation of CES occurrence with biophysical and infrastructural variables. This method allowed us to identify and map the social preferences for CES in this area. The distance to the ocean and distance to touristic and cultural infrastructure were the most determinant variables to explain CES distribution in PNSACV. Another relevant result of this study was the identification of pairs of CES (such as Recreation {\&} Aesthetics services) with a significant spatial overlap. Using social media data can be an expedite and cost-effective way to identify and map CES, although this approach embodies some challenges and biases that need to be considered. The use of species distribution models, such as Maxent, can be particularly valuable to support the design of future scenarios and assist decision-making on land use planning.},

abstract = {Recognition of the importance of land-use history and its legacies in most ecological systems has been a major factor driving the recent focus on human activity as a legitimate and essential subject of environmental science. Ecologists, conservationists, and natural resource policymakers now recognize that the legacies of land-use activities continue to influence ecosystem structure and function for decades or centuries—or even longer—after those activities have ceased. Consequently, recognition of these historical legacies adds explanatory power to our understanding of modern conditions at scales from organisms to the globe and reduces missteps in anticipating or managing for future conditions. As a result, environmental history emerges as an integral part of ecological science and conservation planning. By considering diverse ecological phenomena, ranging from biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles to ecosystem resilience to anthropogenic stress, and by examining terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in temperate to tropical biomes, this article demonstrates the ubiquity and importance of land-use legacies to environmental science and management.},

Although initially designed to assess the influence of fragment area on Amazonian biotas, the project has yielded insights that go far beyond the original scope of the study. Results suggest that edge effects play a key role in fragment dynamics, that the matrix has a major influence on fragment connectivity and functioning, and that many Amazonian species avoid even small ({\textless}100-m-wide) clearings. The effects of fragmentation are highly eclectic, altering species richness and abundances, species invasions, forest dynamics, the trophic structure of communities, and a variety of ecological and ecosystem processes.

abstract = {Aim Climate, topography and soils drive many patterns of plant distribution and abundance across landscapes, but current plant communities may also reflect a legacy of past disturbance such as agricultural land use. To assess the relative influences of environmental conditions and disturbance history on vegetation, it is important to understand how these forces interact. This study relates the geographical distribution of land uses to variation in topography and soils; evaluates the consequences of land-use decisions for current forests; and examines the effects of agricultural land use on the chemical properties of forest soils. Location Tompkins County occupies 1250 km(2) in central New York's Finger Lakes region. Like much of eastern North America, this area underwent forest clearance for agriculture during the 1800s and widespread field abandonment and forest recovery during the 1900s. The current landscape consists of a patchwork of forests that were never cleared, forests that developed on old fields and active agricultural lands. Methods We investigated relationships among topography, soils and land-use decisions by gathering information about land-use history, slope, aspect, elevation, soil lime content, soil drainage and accessibility in a geographic information system (GIS). To assess the effects of agriculture on forest soil chemistry, we measured pH, organic matter content and extractable nutrient concentrations in field-collected soil samples from 47 post-agricultural and uncleared forests. Results Steeper slopes, less accessible lands and lower-lime soils tended to remain forested, and farmers were more likely to abandon fields that were steeper, farther from roads, lower in lime and more poorly drained. Slope had by far the greatest impact on patterns of clearance and abandonment, and accessibility had a surprisingly strong influence on the distribution of land uses. The effects of other factors varied more, depending for example on location within the county. Current forest types differed accordingly in topography and soil attributes, particularly slope, but they also showed much overlap. Post-agricultural and uncleared forest soils had similar chemical properties. Forests on lands abandoned from agriculture 80-100 years before had slightly higher pH and nutrient concentrations than adjacent, uncleared forests, but these changes were small compared to environmental variation across the county. Main conclusions Despite differential use of lands according to their topography and soils, the substantial influence of accessibility and the relatively small scale of land-use decisions allowed for broad similarity among forest types. Thus, the topography and soil differences created by land-use decisions probably contribute little to landscape-level patterns of diversity. Subtle changes in forest soil chemistry left from past agriculture may nevertheless affect plant distribution and abundance at finer scales.},
annote = {An investigation into the spatial correlates of forest clearance and agricultural abandonment. The authors reconstructed land cover in Tompkins County from 1900 to 1995 and examined relationships between geomorphology characteristics and historical land-use decisions with multiple logistic regressions. GIS work was done on a 50 m grid. Slope had the strongest impact on land use and abandonment. Forested areas tended to be steeper, lower-lime soils, and less accessible. Soil drainage/moisture did not affect land use; but access/arbitrary convenience issues was a major factor in land-use deicisons. Soil chemistry was largely similar between primary and secondary forests - a finding that contrasts several other studies that have shown more pronounced agricultural legacies on forest soils. We should consider the reciprocal interactions between environmental variation and land use - some geomorphology factors that predicted historical land use may have also been affected by historical land use.},

abstract = {Few data sets have characterized carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools in woody debris at sites where other aspects of C and N cycling are studied and histories of land use and disturbance are well documented. We quantified pools of mass, C, and N in fine and coarse woody debris (CWD) in two contrasting stands: a 73-year-old red pine plantation on abandaned agricultural land and a naturally regenerated deciduous forest that has experienced several disturbances in the past 150 years. Masses of downed woody debris amounted to 40.0 mg/ha in the coniferous stand and 26.9 Mg/ha in the deciduous forest (20.4 and 13.8 Mg C/ha, respectively). Concentrations of N were higher and C:N ratios were lower in the deciduous forest compared to the coniferous. Pools of N amounted to 146 kg N/ha in the coniferous stand and 155 kg N/ha in the deciduous forest; both are larger than previously published pools of N in woody debris of temperate forests. Woody detritus buring in O horizons was minimal in these forests, contrary to previous findings in forests of New England. Differences in the patterns of mass, C, and N in size and decay classes of woody debris were related to stand histories. In the naturally regenerated deciduous forest, detritus was distributed across all size categories, and most CWD mass and N was present in the most advanced decay stages. In the coniferous plantation, nearly all of the CWD mass was present in the smallest size class (less than 25 cm diameter), and a recognizable cohort of decayed stems was evident from the stem-exclusion phase of this even-aged stand. These results indicate that heterogeneities in site histories should be explicitly included when biogeochemical process models are used to scale C and N stocks in woody debris to landscapes and regions.},

abstract = {Terrestrial plant litter is an important subsidy to freshwater ecosystems, where it serves as a basal resource in benthic food webs. Litter quantity and decomposition rate strongly influence energy flow through these food webs. Litter quantity often increases following nonnative plant invasions, but the impact this additional litter has on aquatic consumers is largely unknown. We conducted an experiment in outdoor microcosms containing plant litter, microbes, algae, and tadpoles. Many tadpoles feed on biofilms (bacteria, fungi, and algae) that develop during decomposition; as such, they are ideal organisms to test bottom-up effects of litter subsidies. We used a related pair of native and nonnative wetland grasses to investigate whether litter quantity affects tadpole performance. Tadpole performance metrics (developmental stage, size, and survival) showed significant positive responses to increased litter quantity but were mostly unaffected by plant species. Therefore, litter quantity was the primary determinant of tadpole performance in our experimental community. We suggest that changes to litter quantity can have important impacts on larval amphibians. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.},

abstract = {American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was transformed with a wheat oxalate oxidase (oxo) gene in an effort to degrade the oxalic acid (OA) secreted by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, thus decreasing its virulence. Expression of OxO was examined under two promoters: a strong constitutive promoter, CaMV 35S, and a predominantly vascular promoter, VspB. Oxo gene transcription was quantified by RT-qPCR. Relative expression of OxO varied approximately 200 fold among events produced with the 35S-OxO. The lowest 35S-OxO event expressed approximately 3,000 fold higher than the highest VspB-OxO event. This was potentially due to the tissue-specific nature of the VspB-controlled expression, the strength of the CaMV 35S constitutive promoter, or position effects. Leaf assays measuring necrotic lesion length were conducted to better understand the relationship between OxO expression level and the blight fungus in planta. A threshold response was observed between the OxO expression level and the C. parasitica lesion length. Five events of the 35S-OxO line showed significantly reduced lesion length compared to the blight-susceptible American chestnut.

abstract = {We discuss problems the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm poses for replication and more broadly in the biomedical and social sciences as well as how these problems remain unresolved by proposals involving modified p-value thresholds, confidence intervals, and Bayes factors. We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm--and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it--as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to "ban" p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

There is a positive correlation between phanerogam species diversity and rainfall, and there is a positive correlation with temperature. Bryophyte diversity is correlated positively with relative air humidity. Because the natural vegetation cover in the montane Neotropics of the Andes is now largely fragmentary, separated by barriers composed of large meadows or agricultural fields, future climatic change could lead to mass extinction. A conservation strategy for the Neotropical montane forests should therefore aim at large protected areas, extending from treeline to tropical lowland, along temperature gradients and vertically and horizontally along gradients of rainfall and relative humidity. Where necessary, natural regeneration in deforested areas should be pursued, eventually in corridors connecting reservation areas. -from Author},

abstract = {In ecology, the true causal structure for a given problem is oſten not known, and several plausible models and thus model predictions exist. It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are oſten demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ regarding in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available.We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model's predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will oſten be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimised and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is oſten context-dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.},

abstract = {The analysis of data from social media and social networking sites may be instrumental in achieving a better understanding of human-environment interactions and in shaping future conservation and environmental management. In this study, we systematically map the application of social media data in environmental research. The quantitative review of 169 studies reveals that most studies focus on the analysis of people's behavior and perceptions of the environment, followed by environmental monitoring and applications in environmental planning and governance. The literature testifies to a very rapid growth in the field, with Twitter (52 studies) and Flickr (34 studies) being most frequently used as data sources. A growing number of studies combine data from multiple sites and jointly investigates multiple types of media. A broader, more qualitative review of the insights provided by the investigated studies suggests that while social media data offer unprecedented opportunities in terms of data volume, scale of analysis, and real-time monitoring, researchers are only starting to cope with the challenges of data's heterogeneity and noise levels, potential biases, ethics of data acquisition and use, and uncertainty about future data availability. Critical areas for the development of the field include integration of different types of information in data mashups, development of quality assurance procedures and ethical codes, improved integration with existing methods, and assurance of long-term, free and easy-to-access provision of public social media data for future environmental researchers.},

However, quantifying the connection between humans and nature at a global scale remains challenging. We lack answers to fundamental questions: how do humans experience nature in different contexts (daily routines, fun activities, weddings, honeymoons, other celebrations, and vacations) and how do nature experiences differ across countries? We answer these questions by coupling social media and artificial intelligence using 31,534 social media photographs across 185 countries. We find that nature was more likely to appear in photographs taken during a fun activity, honeymoon, or vacation compared to photographs of daily routines. More importantly, the proportion of photographs with nature taken during fun activities is associated with national life satisfaction scores. This study provides global evidence of the biophilia hypothesis by showing a connection between humans and nature that contributes to life satisfaction and highlights how nature serves as background to many of our positive memories.},

Our study used social media to assess behavioural patterns across different groups of park users in tropical Singapore. 4,674 users were grouped based on the location and content of their photographs on the Flickr platform. We analysed how these groups varied spatially in the parks they visited, as well as in their photography behaviour. Over 250,000 photographs were analysed, including those uploaded and favourited by users, and all photographs taken at city parks. There were significant differences in the number and types of park photographs between tourists and locals, and between user-group axes formed from users' photograph content. Spatial mapping of different user groups showed distinct patterns in the parks they were attracted to. Future work should consider such variability both within and between data sources, to provide a more context-dependent understanding of human–environment interactions and preferences for outdoor recreation.},

Managing this service requires understanding the landscape attributes underpinning its provision, and how changes in land management affect its contribution to human wellbeing over time. However, evidence from both spatially explicit and temporally dynamic analyses is scarce, often due to data limitations. In this study, we investigated nature-based recreation within conserved lands in Vermont, USA.We used geotagged photographs uploaded to the photo-sharingwebsite Flickr to quantify visits by in-state and outof- state visitors, and we multiplied visits by mean trip expenditures to show that conserved lands contributed US {\$}1.8 billion (US {\$}0.18'20.2 at 95{\%} confidence) to Vermont's tourism industry between 2007 and 2014.We found eight landscape attributes explained the pattern of visits to conserved lands; visits were higher in larger conserved lands, with less forest cover, greater trail density and more opportunities for snow sports. Some of these attributes differed from those found in other locations, but all aligned with our understanding of recreation in Vermont.We also found that using temporally static models to informconservation decisions may have perverse outcomes for nature-based recreation. For example, static models suggest conserved land with less forest cover receive more visits, but temporally dynamic models suggest clearing forests decreases, rather than increases, visits to these sites. Our results illustrate the importance of understanding both the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecosystem services for conservation decision-making.},

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R.

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

abstract = {Thanks to recent advances in high-performance computing and deep learning, computer vision algorithms coupled with spatial analysis methods provide a unique opportunity for extracting human activity patterns from geo-tagged social media images. However, there are only a handful of studies that evaluate the utility of computer vision algorithms for studying large-scale human activity patterns. In this article, we introduce an analytical framework that integrates a computer vision algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with kernel density estimation to identify objects, and infer human activity patterns from geo-tagged photographs. To demonstrate our framework, we identify bird images to infer birdwatching activity from approximately 20 million publicly shared images on Flickr, across a three-year period from December 2013 to December 2016. In order to assess the accuracy of object detection, we compared results from the computer vision algorithm to concept-based image retrieval, which is based on keyword search on image metadata such as textual description, tags, and titles of images. We then compared patterns in birding activity generated using Flickr bird photographs with patterns identified using eBird data-an online citizen science bird observation application. The results of our eBird comparison highlight the potential differences and biases in casual and serious birdwatching, and similarities and differences among behaviors of social media and citizen science users. Our analysis results provide valuable insights into assessing the credibility and utility of geo-tagged photographs in studying human activity patterns through object detection and spatial analysis.},

abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) is a useful framework for land-use decision making oriented to, ensure human well-being. Outdoor recreation potential, as a cultural ecosystem service, pose, particular challenges to its evaluation and mapping: it depends to a greater extent that other ES on, stakeholder{\'{s}} perception and values, it has lower generalization capacity, the delimitation of, provisioning areas is not straightforward and it should be evaluated at different spatial scales. In this, study, we propose a conceptual framework and method that is intended to cope with these challenges. Our method is based on landscape metrics measured at coarse scale, and campsite density as an, indicator of ecosystem service supply and benefit capture. We applied this method to a case study in, Argentina. We estimated outdoor recreation potential level using a quantile multiple regression, analysis of the 0.9 quantile of campsite density with nine landscape metrics determinants of ecosystem, service supply. We also explored two determinants of benefit capture with a linear stepwise regression, analysis of differences between the predicted recreation potential and actual use. We stratified the, analysis by ecoregion to distinguish the different weight of determinants of ecosystem service supply, and benefit capture. The examined landscape determinants showed differences in their explicative capacity of outdoor, recreation potential across ecoregions, showing that their generalization capacity is limited. For, example, and contrary to our expectations, crop area did not have a negative effect for any of the 15, analyzed ecoregions. In fact, significant correlations are positive for three cases. Forest cover, on the, other hand, had a positive effect only in the Pampas ecoregion, originally dominated by grasslands and, where current forests consist in plantations of exotic trees. Results also showed that, in general, unrealized benefit increases with road and population density. Our method makes a contribution to the study of recreation potential under the framework of ES by, taking into account important aspects that are sometimes overlooked. It considers the differences with, other ecosystem services in terms of the underlying processes that control ecosystem service supply, and benefit capture and it can be applied at a very wide spatial extent, at which approaches with other, methods that are more information demanding is difficult. Yet complementary methods at more, detailed spatial scales would provide additional information for a comprehensive estimation of, outdoor recreation potential. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A substantial body of models, methods, and data relevant to cultural services has been developed within the social and behavioral sciences before and outside of the ES approach. A selective review of work in landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation, and spiritual significance demonstrates opportunities for operationally defining cultural services in terms of socioecological models, consistent with the larger set of ES. Such models explicitly link ecological structures and functions with cultural values and benefits, facilitating communication between scientists and stakeholders and enabling economic, multicriterion, deliberative evaluation and other methods that can clarify tradeoffs and synergies involving cultural ES. Based on this approach, a common representation is offered that frames cultural services, along with all ES, by the relative contribution of relevant ecological structures and functions and by applicable social evaluation approaches. This perspective provides a foundation for merging ecological and social science epistemologies to define and integrate cultural services better within the broader ES framework.},

abstract = {Cultural ecosystem services, such as aesthetic and recreational enjoyment, as well as sense of place and local identity, play an outstanding role in the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. Online data shared on social networks, particularly geo-tagged photos, are becoming an increasingly attractive source of information about cultural ecosystem services. Landscape photographs tell about the significance of human relationships with landscapes, human practices in landscapes and the landscape features that might possess value in terms of cultural ecosystem services. Despite all the recent advances in this emerging methodological approach, some challenges remain to be explored: (a) how to assess a broad suite of cultural ecosystem services, beyond aesthetic beauty of landscapes, (b) how to identify the landscape features that are relevant for providing cultural ecosystem services and determine trade-offs and synergies among cultural ecosystem services. To address these challenges, we have developed a methodological approach suitable for eliciting the importance of cultural ecosystem services and the landscape features underpinning their provision across five different sites in Europe (in Estonia, Greece, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). We have performed a content analysis of 1.404 photos uploaded in Flickr and Panoramio platforms that can represent cultural ecosystem services. Four bundles of landscapes features and cultural ecosystem services showed the relation of recreation with mountain areas (terrestrial recreation) and with water bodies (aquatic recreation). Cultural heritage, social and spiritual values were particularly attached to landscapes with woodpastures and grasslands, as well as urban features and infrastructures, i.e. to more anthropogenic landscapes. A positive though weak relationship was found between landscape diversity and cultural ecosystem services diversity. Particularly wood-pastures and shrubs were more frequently portrayed in all study sites in comparison with their actual land cover. The results can be of interest both for methodological purposes in the face of an increasing trend in the use of geo-tagged photos in the ecosystem services research and for the elicitation and comparison of landscape values across European cultural landscapes.},

Such data may allow to advance the approach, scale and timespan to which ES are assessed, mapping and valued. This is especially relevant in the context of developing regions whose decision support tools are often limited by a lack of resources and funding. This research presents an economic valuation tool for recreational ES, suitable at wide spatial scales, relying on crowdsourced metadata from social media with a proof of concept tested on an Indian tropical Ramsar wetland. We demonstrate how geotagged photographs from Flickr can be used in the context of a developing country to (i) map nature-based recreation patterns, (ii) value recreational ecosystem services, and (iii) investigate how recreational benefits are affected by changes in ecosystem quality. The case-study application is the Vembanad Lake in Kerala, India, and the adjacent backwaters. Geographic Information Systems are implemented to extract 4328 Flickr photographs that are used to map hot spots of recreation and infer the home location of wetland visitors from within Kerala state with good accuracy. An individual, single-site travel cost demand function is generated and estimated using both Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions, which results in mean consumer surplus estimates between Rs. 2227–3953 ({\$}34–{\$}62) per visit and annual domestic recreation benefits of Rs. 7.53–13.37 billion ({\$}115.5–{\$}205 million) in the investigated wetlands. Improvement in water quality to a level that supports wildlife and fisheries is projected to result in a Rs. 260 million ({\$}4 million) annual increase in recreational benefits, while restoring previously encroached lake area would result in almost Rs. 50 million ({\$}760,000) in yearly value increase.},

abstract = {In the western United States, livestock grazing often co-exists with recreation, cultural resource management and biodiversity protection on federal and state protected rangelands as well as on many local government open space areas. While the value of livestock grazing for managing rangeland vegetation to reduce fire fuel loads and improve wildlife habitat is increasingly recognized by resource management professionals, public concerns, and conflict between recreationist and livestock have led to reductions in public land grazing. Traditional public input methods yield a constrained picture of people's attitudes toward cows and public land grazing. Public meetings, hearings, and surveys, the most commonly used mechanisms for public land managers to solicit public opinion, tend to foster participation of organized special interests or, in the case of surveys, focus on a specific topic. General public input is limited. This study explored the use of personal photography in social media to gain insight into public perceptions of livestock grazing in public spaces. Key findings of this study include that many recreationist in grazed San Francisco Bay Area parks shared views, interests, and concerns about cows and grazing on the photo-sharing website, FlickrTM that seldom show up at a public meeting or in surveys. Results suggest that social media analysis can help develop a more nuanced understanding of public viewpoints useful in making decisions and creating outreach and education programs for public grazing lands. This study demonstrates that using such media can be useful in gaining an understanding of public concerns about natural resource management. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

Thus far, visitor information has been collected mostly with repeated visitor surveys. A wealth of content-rich geographic data is produced by users of different social media platforms. These data could potentially provide continuous information about people's activities and interactions with the environment at different spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we compare social media data with traditional survey data in order to map people's activities and preferences using the most popular national park in Finland, Pallas-Yll stunturi National Park, as a case study. We compare systematically collected survey data and the content of geotagged social media data and analyze: (i) where do people go within the park; (ii) what are their activities; (iii) when do people visit the park and if there are temporal patterns in their activities; (iv) who the visitors are; (v) why people visit the national park; and (vi) what complementary information from social media can provide in addition to the results from traditional surveys. The comparison of survey and social media data demonstrated that geotagged social media content provides relevant information about visitors' use of the national park. As social media platforms are a dynamic source of data, they could complement and enrich traditional forms of visitor monitoring by providing more insight on emerging activities, temporal patterns of shared content, and mobility patterns of visitors. Potentially, geotagged social media data could also provide an overview of the spatio-temporal activity patterns in other areas where systematic visitor monitoring is not taking place.},

In recent years the usage of social media has gained momentum to study the aesthetic preferences and perception of the environment. However, until now the different approaches have not yet been sufficiently combined to provide more in depth understanding of what attracts people in the landscape We propose a robust methodology using social media photos from Flickr and Panoramio to estimate the correlation between landscape attributes and landscape preferences. We combine formal modeling of spatial photo distribution based on the occurrence of landscape elements with content analysis of the photos to pinpoint what it is in a landscape that attracts people. We use the Kromme Rijn Area –a peri-urban area in the center of the Netherlands and a popular recreation area- as case study area. The analysis shows that this area is appreciated by its visitors and residents for the presence of monumental buildings, small water bodies and opportunities for hikes along grasslands. The method successfully linked the structural elements of the landscape with the revealed preferences, providing a way of quantifying the appreciation of the landscape. Qualitative surveys remain essential to study motivations for outdoor recreation, but social media data can be incorporated as evidence of what elements of the landscape are valued, where people are interacting with the landscape, and how these interactions characterize a landscape.},

These six areas are: (1) linkages between people and the environment in landscapes, (2) landscape structure and land-use intensity, (3) long-term landscape history, (4) driving forces, processes, and actors of landscape change, (5) landscape values and meanings, and (6) landscape stewardship. We propose that these knowledge areas can contribute to the study of ecosystem change and society, considering nested multiscale dynamics of social-ecological systems; the stewardship of these systems and their ecosystem services; and the relationships between ecosystem services, human well-being, wealth, and poverty.

abstract = {Outdoor recreation is one of many important benefits provided by public lands. Data on recreational use are critical for informing management of recreation resources, however, managers often lack actionable information on visitor use for large protected areas that lack controlled access points. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential for social media data (e.g., geotagged images shared on Flickr and trip reports shared on a hiking forum) to provide land managers with useful measures of recreational use to dispersed areas, and to provide lessons learned from comparing several more traditional counting methods. First, we measure daily and monthly visitation rates to individual trails within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest (MBSNF) in western Washington. At 15 trailheads, we compare counts of hikers from infrared sensors, timelapse cameras, and manual on-site counts, to counts based on the number of shared geotagged images and trip reports from those locations. Second, we measure visitation rates to each National Forest System (NFS) unit across the US and compare annual measurements derived from the number of geotagged images to estimates from the US Forest Service National Visitor Use Monitoring Program. At both the NFS unit and the individual-trail scales, we found strong correlations between traditional measures of recreational use and measures based on user-generated content shared on the internet. For national forests in every region of the country, correlations between official Forest Service statistics and geotagged images ranged between 55{\%} and 95{\%}. For individual trails within the MBSNF, monthly visitor counts from on-site measurements were strongly correlated with counts from geotagged images (79{\%}) and trip reports (91{\%}). The convenient, cost-efficient and timely nature of collecting and analyzing user-generated data could allow land managers to monitor use over different seasons of the year and at sites and scales never previously monitored, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of recreational use patterns and values.},

abstract = {Pervasive presence of location-sharing services made it possible for researchers to gain an unprecedented access to the direct records of human activity in space and time. This article analyses geo-located Twitter messages in order to uncover global patterns of human mobility. Based on a dataset of almost a billion tweets recorded in 2012, we estimate the volume of international travelers by country of residence. Mobility profiles of different nations were examined based on such characteristics as mobility rate, radius of gyration, diversity of destinations, and inflow-outflow balance. Temporal patterns disclose the universally valid seasons of increased international mobility and the particular character of international travels of different nations. Our analysis of the community structure of the Twitter mobility network reveals spatially cohesive regions that follow the regional division of the world. We validate our result using global tourism statistics and mobility models provided by other authors and argue that Twitter is exceptionally useful for understanding and quantifying global mobility patterns. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s).},
